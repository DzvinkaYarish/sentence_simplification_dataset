People said that the ray swam into the fishermen\u2019s net as they trawled for fish in a homemade wooden boat.The enormous, 8-metre creature was found in the La Crove cave in waters near the border with Ecuador. A fisherman said that it was so big, that it could not be loaded onto their boat and had to be transported by a tow truck.In ancient Peru, the manta ray, which is in the same biological order as smaller stingrays, was often represented in art where they were feared because of their size. People believed that they ate fish and sank boats, and it was not until the late 1970\u2019s that perceptions began to change. This was when people realised that they were actually pretty placid and harmless to humans", "In the US, Texas is getting ready for the strongest storm to come to the mainland in 12 years. Scientists named this storm Hurricane Harvey, and it could become a Category 3 hurricane, which means that its winds will reach 210 kilometres/hour.In coastal regions, the government issued mandatory evacuations and at 100 miles inland, people reinforced their homes. A sheriff warned people that they needed to leave and that he would not send boats to rescue them if they chose to stay", "A Swiss agricultural institute made a revelation of why Swiss cheese has holes in it: hay. Traditionally, people gather milk via buckets open to the air, and this means that microscopically small particles of hay can get into the milk, which creates holes as the liquid matures into cheese.Through a series of tests, scientists tried adding different amounts of hay dust to milk in the cheese-making process. They found that they could regulate the number of holes.This research also solves another mystery of why the famous holes in cheeses like Emmentaller are getting smaller or disappearing during the last fifteen years. This is due to milk becoming cleaner through the use of industrial milking systems", "At least 23 people died in violent protests over the rape conviction of a popular religious leader in North India.

This situation gave people a strange idea to make something.These people attempted to create the world\u2019s biggest helicopter model made out of horsemeat sausages and other horse products. The model was over 3.5 metres long, about 1.8 metres high, and it weighed about 120 kilos.The helicopter\u2019s blades rotated and people proudly demonstrated them to a fascinated crowd and local chefs.

The pieces, understood to be 1,300 to 1,400 years old, were excavated at two archaeological sites in May 2015.The co-director of the archaeological project of these panels gave scientists very detailed information about how a Mayan ruler becomes a king. This kind of information is often not explicated with as much detail in other texts.The panels make up the most significant Mayan discovery since archaeologists uncovered a text containing the so-called \u2018end date\u2019 of the Mayan calendar at the same site in 2012.

It turned out that men consistently thought they had done better than they actually had. The women\u2019s estimations, on the other hand, were right on the money.Although the sample was quite small, researchers say that gender gaps in areas like science, engineering, and maths may be the result of men thinking too highly of their performance.

Gossip is what makes people human, because it allows us to pass on vital information on who to trust and who not to trust, as well as bond with family and friends.In evolutionary biology, scientists call the phenomenon gossip theory. The theory suggests that as language developed, it allowed early humans to pass on reliable information so that they could live in ever-increasing groups. Gossiping used to be simply what people did with their friends and was not used in a negative sense until the 18th century.Scientists carried out experiments to find out what people thought about gossips, and the results were that while people distrust those who gossip too much, they were also wary of those who gossip too little.Professor Robin Dunbar at Oxford University even said that we should accept gossiping as a vital part of human life, which might even help us live longer.

Creepy-crawlies invade the town; people found homes and gardens covered with the spiders and mounds of their silky threads.The terrifying scenes would probably cause mass panic in most places, however the phenomenon commonly known as \u2018Spider Rain\u2019, \u2018Angel Hair\u2019 and \u2018ballooning\u2019, is not uncommon across parts of Australia. Ballooning is a form of spider transportation which is when some species of spiders climb to the highest heights that they possibly can, like on the tops of plants or trees. They then use their web as parachutes and leap off. The silk catches on the breeze and carries the spider. People are then left with the gossamer, which is the name for the silver sheets of silken webs left behind. Reportedly, this is going on around us all the time, but at a much smaller scale.The spiders can often travel a pretty big distance and people have seen some come flying more than 2.9 kilometres above the ground. Spiders are thought to come raining down because of a preceding change in a weather conditions. If it rains a lot and the ground gets waterlogged, spiders move their way upwards to avoid drowning", "The harsh Australian desert has animal graveyards due to predators that were introduced to the area and that are now wiping out the small, endangered mammals that live there.

Sasha Dench is gearing up for a 4,500-mile (7,242 kilometres) flight from the Russian Arctic to Britain with a giant fan strapped to her back.\u201cThese are the risers, this is what I\u2019m hanging off from in-flight, how I\u2019m connected to the wing. I\u2019ve got my brakes here, which I can pull down to steer, and for my accelerator, it\u2019s basically just this strap here, so as you release that, I basically then make the wing fall faster and so I get about another 30, 35 kilometres an hour just by releasing those straps.\u201dThe journey is one made every year by thousands of Bewick\u2019s swans and it\u2019s their migratory flight that Sasha hopes to observe. Their numbers have halved in the past 20 years but nobody knows exactly why.\u201cWe know quite a few of the threats that they face from illegal shooting, ingesting lead shot which they get blood poisoning from, hitting power lines \u2013 that\u2019s another big problem, but what we also know is that none of those threats on their own is bad enough to be causing the decline as it is, so there might be another piece of the puzzle that we\u2019re missing. What we do know is that a load of the birds won\u2019t survive migration this year.\u201dThe route will take Sasha over 11 countries and with no roads below her for the first 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometres) there will be no ground crew to assist her.

At the Kremlin, Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev thanked the National Olympic team in a pretty generous way.Some happy news for the team which has otherwise been blighted by doping scandals and the disqualification of the entire track and field team.The Prime Minister said that no matter how some were trying, they didn\u2019t succeed in disrupting the Olympics for Russia. The team has proved to the entire world that the victories of our sport have nothing to do with doping or with some sin they try to label us with. Very convincing results were achieved with an honest and beautiful fight.And that beautiful fight resulted in 100 medallists receiving the cars.Despite only 285 of 387 Russian athletes being allowed to compete in the games, the team accumulated enough gold medals for them to finish in an impressive fourth place", "It\u00b4s rare that an item of clothing sparks such controversy, even to the point of polarising a nation, but after recent incidents of women being asked to remove their burkini in French beach resorts, it\u2019s safe to say that this piece of fabric, has truly got people talking.The so-called burkini is a linguistic melange of the Muslim garment, the burka, with a bikini. A swimsuit that covers a woman\u2019s body, leaving only her face, hands and feet exposed.Seemingly inoffensive, in 2009 a woman was banned from a public pool in Paris for wearing the item. Now, in the secular country, many French resorts are banning the garment entirely.Although not everyone agrees, this French beach-goer says, \u201cIf someone besides him want to wear a burkini, he wouldn\u2019t really care and that the majority of the population sees the ban as an infringement of rights.\u201dHowever, Prime Minister Manuel Valls defends the hard-line approach, calling the burkini a symbol of enslavement of women. He says that asking someone to remove their burkini is like if a woman in a public area were indecent, they\u2019d too be asked to cover up.Many critics argue that the ban could provoke violent reaction from Islamic terrorists in a country that\u2019s already endured a slew of attacks. It may just be a piece of material, but for many, clearly, the burkini has a lot more underlying meaning to it", "Some might consider a trip to an art gallery a perfect date, but now it\u2019s become a doggy play-date.

In those metallic materials, there were shards of blades and wood which were very unusual. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in my 20 years of practice.

He was thinking she\u2019ll probably say no to him and that he didn\u2019t know.Thankfully, she didn\u2019t say no, and the romantic gesture even cushioned the blow of missing out on gold.He Zi says missing out is definitely a regret, so she wasn\u2019t that excited and emotional as you can see when he proposed. She said she\u2019s been training for almost 20 years and worked really hard for this dream so was disappointed when she won silver. But the next day, the proposal made her feel more than happy after what he did for her.This comes after Brazilian rugby sevens player Isadora Cerullo was proposed to by her girlfriend on the pitch after the grand final. Other Olympic love birds include Britain\u2019s 20-kilometre race walker Tom Bosworth who proposed to his boyfriend on Copacabana Beach, and American triple jumper, William Claye, who proposed to his girlfriend after winning a silver medal in his event.And clearly the rest of the city are feeling the love, too.

Chow, an animal trainer, had decided to take Chickaboo back to the farm where she\u2019d originally been born because she got too big for him to keep.Jeff Sandhu, the man who filmed the video, said he had visited the ostrich in her new home, and she was safe and doing well", "The BMW Group has marked its centenary by looking ahead to its next 100 years, and unveiling two new vision vehicles.The German group unveiled its new Rolls-Royce at a centenary event in London. The car will be fully autonomous and comes complete with an artificial intelligence system called Eleanor, who speaks and takes commands from passengers.And in case you\u2019re wondering how to get your hands on one, this beauty won\u2019t be available until 2040, but it will be completely bespoke and emission free, paving the way for the first green luxury cars from the British brand.\u201cWe\u2019re entering a phase now where zero emissions are going to be more the norm. We\u2019re entering a phase where digitise or digitalisation and connectivity are part of everyday life. It\u2019s likely in the big urban areas to be a shared environment, and this whole step in technology of autonomous driving is going to play a significant role, as well.\u201dMINI\u2019s vision of the future car was also unveiled. It too will drive autonomously, is highly personalised and recognises a driver.Carmakers are hoping shorter charge times, greater ranges, more charging points and the fallout from Volkswagen\u2019s diesel emissions scandal will all help to convert customers from conventional cars to the newer models", "We\u2019ve all found ourselves trying to keep our head above the water at some point in our lives, and this Peruvian doggy is no exception. The pooch found itself stranded in a canal in Trujillo on Wednesday, but luckily, police officers were on hand to help it out.One officer even stripped down to his underwear and got into the water to help the drowning animal.In the end, the police officer in the water grabbed the dog and handed it to the first in line of the human chain that had been formed along the canal bank. The dog was pulled to safety and only looked a little shaken up by the ordeal", "This is what\u2019s left of a part of a motorway bridge in Germany.The bridge that was under construction in Bavaria collapsed on Wednesday, killing at least one construction worker. A 40-metre part of the bridge plunged 20 metres to the ground while construction workers were working on the site. One worker was killed and another 12 injured.The Schraudenbach Valley bridge will carry part of the A7 motorway, which presently runs alongside on the old bridge and was luckily not affected.Initially, several deaths were reported, with police unable to say how many workers had been trapped and whether any cars had been travelling on the road beneath. Police are not entirely sure of how many people may still be trapped under the rubble, as a small road and cycle path run parallel to the bridge, making it difficult to get through all of the debris.Four helicopters and a dozen ambulances were brought in to transport the injured to hospital", "Disney has opened its first theme park in mainland China today. This comes just a day after a 2-year-old toddler was grabbed and killed by an alligator at the Orlando Disney resort.Tens of thousands of fans flocked to the theme park today after a grand opening ceremony.Disney\u2019s largest overseas investment at 5.5 billion dollars, the park is a bet on China\u2019s middle class and booming domestic tourism. The U.S. firm hopes it will offset an otherwise lacklustre international theme park business.Disney\u2019s chief executive stressed that China is continuing to make itself more attractive to investment from around the world that in turn is mutually beneficial to America. He even had a message from President Barack Obama.\u201cThe opening occurs during the US-China Tourism Year and it reflects the growing relationship between our nations. It promotes further cultural exchanges and underscores the importance of China continuing to make itself more attractive to investment from around the world that is mutually beneficial to both our countries. Barack Obama.\u201dThe company has said that they aimed to build China Disneyland rather than Disneyland in China. With that in mind, Main Street has been replaced by Mickey Avenue to reduce the feel of Americana, while attractions include the Chinese-style Wandering Moon tea house, a Chinese Zodiac-themed garden, and a Tarzan musical featuring Chinese acrobats.The firm estimates 330 million people within a 3-hour radius of Shanghai, the country\u2019s financial centre, will be able to afford to come to the park.

The violence broke out in the early hours of this morning after pubs and bars closed in the northern French city, where Russia are playing Slovakia this afternoon. The area is seen as a potential trouble spot as England fans congregate ahead of their match against Wales in nearby Lens on Thursday.Both teams have been threatened with expulsion from the competition after dozens of fans were injured in Marseille last week.In Lille, thousands of extra police officers have been drafted in to keep the crowds under control, and sales of alcohol will be limited before the matches", "Food riots and violent looting have become a daily occurrence across Venezuela and a major problem for the struggling leftist government of President Nicolas Maduro. Despite spending hours in queues, Venezuelans increasingly find that supplies of subsidised flour or rice run out before they can buy them.This woman told the president that everyone, not just his opponents, is going hungry. Subsidised state-run supermarkets financed revenue were among the most appreciated programs of late President Hugo Chavez\u2019s 14-year rule. But oil prices have collapsed under his successor Maduro, leaving the country with less money by oil to import food.What\u2019s more, local firms have little interest in producing because price controls often mean they have to sell their products below cost price. People are being forced to turn to the black market where products like milk or sugar often fetch 10 times regulated prices.More than a quarter of 641 protests last month were for food, a figure that has risen every month this year and is up 3 times from May 2015. Venezuela\u2019s angry streets are arguably a bigger threat for Maduro than the political opposition, with recent food protests coming within blocks of the Miraflores Presidential Palace", "We\u2019ve all heard of counting sheep to fall asleep but in Thailand it\u2019s humans helping elephants nod off with lullabies.

That\u2019s what this London vet found when he went to change the dishwasher.A fox cub, presumably looking for food, had got himself stuck in the appliance and, luckily for him, the house belonged to a vet. Simon Hayes was getting on with household jobs when he saw the fox cub wedged behind the dish trolley.With his years of experience as a vet, Simon could tell that the fox was just a few months old and seemed to be very scared. He removed the dishwasher\u2019s bottom trolley and, after some persuasion with a sweeping brush, the frightened animal crept out and made a dash for the garden.The vet said after the fox escaped he was spotted back with his mother", "As another football tournament kicks off it\u2019s not the players that are garnering all the attention but rather a collection of animals hoping to prove their psychic powers.

The German zoo director said the animals were both picked due to their impartial nature to European football.After a long moment of deliberation, Oobi-Ooobi picked neither the jar, predicting that Germany will draw with Ukraine. Astrid the sea lion, on the other hand, foresaw a win for Ukraine, presenting his German keepers with the bad news", "A soldier is lucky to be alive after a grenade embedded itself in his face. The incident happened in Colombia and surgeons had to be especially careful with the operation.Leandro Jose Luna was transferred in an eight-hour ambulance ride to Bogota after authorities said they could not risk moving the patient by helicopter due to the risk of the explosive detonating.The chief surgeon dealing with the unusual case said that the team had to improvise and operate outside to minimise impact on the hospital if the grenade exploded. But he said the operation had been a success and that within a few days the soldier could reintegrate into his military unit and his family to make a full recovery.According to authorities, the incident occurred when a fellow soldier on patrol with Luna accidentally activated a grenade launcher, throwing the 40-millimetre grenade into his right jaw.Well, we\u2019ve all heard the Bruno Mars\u2019 song, but this takes it to a whole new level", "John F.

And there\u2019s no doubt in its authenticity.\u201cWe know this is an absolutely authentic letter that President Kennedy wrote because: One \u2013 it\u2019s on White House stationary. Two, we\u2019ve authenticated his handwriting. And three \u2013 it comes right from his personal secretary, who retained it after the assassination. This letter was written in October 1963 and the President was killed a month later. And we know that Evelyn Lincoln had to remove everything out of the White House when Lyndon Johnson moved in.\u201dBut these four sheets of paper come with a hefty price tag.\u201cThe pre-auction estimate for this letter is 30,000 dollars. But it\u2026 it\u2019s got so much attention from around the world and there\u2019s so much interest in it. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to go for but it\u2019d probably go for a lot more than that.\u201dSome auction experts say the value of the love letter is as much about its meaning today as its historical significance.\u201cI think what\u2019s really fascinating about these Kennedy lots and this Kennedy auction is 50 years later, it still brings relevance to today\u2019s situation of senators maybe having affairs, extortions and just\u2026 just scandal.\u201dThe sale will be held online only on June 23 from Boston in a rare opportunity for one lucky bidder to get their hands on a piece of history", "A police officer has caught a suspect by yes, you guessed it, pretending to be a dog.

And it\u2019s just something that you think on your feet and you give it a go. Luckily, it paid off.\u201dIt all started on the streets of southwest England on Thursday. PC Hutton and his team from Wiltshire Police were involved in a high speed chase on the M4 near Swindon.They used stinger devices to bring the car to a stop and it worked. The four young people in the vehicle tried to flee but quick thinking and the unusual tactic stopped one man from getting away.\u201cAbout 20 seconds into the chase, I realised that I probably wasn\u2019t going to be able to gain on him due to the distance he\u2019d made on me. So I decided to try a tactic which I have tried years ago before. And that was to put in a challenge as if I was a dog handler and then give some fake barks.\u201dPC Hutton has been the subject of a fair few jokes since the incident but who cares if people think you\u2019re barking mad if it means you get your man?", "The appearance of a 14-foot mural on the side of a classroom would be met with disapproval in many schools.

On Friday, he was found at a military hut a few miles from where he was last seen having survived without food for days.But today the saga finally came to an end as Yamato emerged from hospital.

It\u2019s resistant to dirt and moisture so the note won\u2019t wear out as quickly as the current fibres. It\u2019s stronger than paper and can better withstand being repeatedly folded into wallets or scrunched up into pockets. Polymer notes can survive a splash of claret, a flick of cigar ash, a nip of a bulldog and even the spin afterwards in the washing machine.\u201dThe new plastic five-pound note will go into circulation in September with 440 million notes being printed.For the last 300 years, Brits have been content with paper money, but not anymore as the nation follows countries such as Canada and Australia in the plastic one-der revolution.And this is just the beginning.

They skip school or drop out altogether in order to help their families make a living \u2013 many only making the equivalent of a dollar a day.But human rights groups are trying to change things. Human Rights Watch has reached out to some of the biggest companies operating in Indonesia, asking them to educate the families about the dangers of this work.But change requires the cooperation of many stakeholders, including the Indonesian government, which says it is working on the issue. The head of Indonesia\u2019s Child Protection Agency says that any person, who employs a child, which is prohibited by law, including in the tobacco industry, which has a wide impact on public health, should be punished because it is a criminal offence.It is estimated over 1.5 million children are working in Indonesia\u2019s agricultural sector \u2013 mainly in tobacco, rubber and palm oil plantations.

And when full service begins in December, travellers will see the time it takes for them to get from Zurich to Milan cut by nearly 3 hours.While the 12-billion-dollar project has been praised for finishing on time and within budget, the venture hasn\u2019t been without opposition. During the 17 years of construction, engineers had to dig through 73 different kinds of rock, some as hard as granite, with temperatures of 46 degrees. Nine workers lost their lives.But Swiss voters fought hard to see the project realised. Today they were the first ones to enjoy this inaugural trip", "Billionaire Elon Musk has done it again, successfully landing this SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on a platform floating in the middle of the ocean.

Leila, the oldest, is 2 minutes 30 seconds faster than Liina, with Lily, the youngest, a further 45 seconds behind.\u201cWe usually support each other.

Wagenknecht, who is a member of Germany\u2019s far left Linke Party, was sitting in the front row during the opening speech at a party conference when a young man stopped in front of her and threw the pie in her face. The man was quickly pulled away by security guards as party officials asked reporters not to film the politician and shielded her from the cameras.Wagenknecht previously advocated putting a cap on the number of refugees Germany should accept \u2013 a stance from which her party has distanced itself.She is the second politician to be attacked with a dessert over her position in recent weeks \u2013 a member of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party having suffered a similar fate just last month", "I think someone needs to alert the French authorities \u2013 a Paris icon has vanished.French artist JR has made the Louvre\u2019s pyramid disappear.

From a specific spot in the museum\u2019s courtyard, it appears as if the huge glass pyramid has disappeared.The French artist has transformed buildings and neighbourhoods around the world with his work, turning streets into giant collages.

The Dallas Zoo has added a baby elephant to its family and have released this new video of the little guy collapsing in a heap of hay.A male African elephant calf was born on May 14th to Mlilo, who was one of several elephants rescued from drought-plagued Swaziland earlier this year. The baby elephant, who hasn\u2019t been named, measures 3 feet tall (91 centimetres) and weighs 175 pounds (79 kilograms). His birth, which zoo staff describe as uneventful, is being hailed as a victory for the zoo, who were concerned that Mlilo\u2019s pregnancy could be impacted by the move from Swaziland to Dallas.At least 17 elephants have been brought to US zoos from Swaziland this year, after experts decided the elephants would perish in Africa due to the lack of water and grass.After his birth, the baby elephant\u2019s took close to his mother, following her around their pen. While the public are very excited to see this little elephant, he isn\u2019t expected to make his public debut for a few months. Zoo officials say he will spend that time bonding with his mother and the rest of the elephants", "Three women hand themselves into police in Derry for taking delivery of abortion pills to pass onto other women too afraid to have them delivered to their own homes.The campaigners were protesting against Northern Ireland\u2019s strict abortion law, which only permits terminations if a woman\u2019s life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental or physical health. The women, who are members of a group called Choice Alliance in Derry, say the law should be the same as in the rest of the UK.\u201cWe\u2019re feeling very angry that it\u2019s illegal. That\u2019s why we\u2019re feeling very angry that women are placed in this situation. That women who can afford to travel to England can have a legal abortion. Women who can\u2019t afford to travel can only access 9-week abortion pills, 60 pounds. We\u2019re very angry about that, we\u2019re very angry that women are being criminalised.\u201dA proposal to legalise abortion was defeated in the Northern Ireland Assembly earlier this year.

The Gyeondyo Bar, which aptly translates to \u201chang in there\u201d, claims to be the first of its kind to cure hangovers.This supermarket representative says the name expresses the hardship of employees who have to suffer a working day after heavy drinking, as well as provides comfort to those who have to come to work early after frequent nights out.While there are pills, beverages, soup and even cosmetics that claim to combat the after-effects of alcohol consumption, the ice lolly is proving rather popular.This man says he likes the grapefruit flavour. Unlike many hangover cure drinks, it doesn\u2019t taste of herbal medicine.Drinking, often in groups of co-workers, is big business in South Korea and so are hangover cures, which generate roughly 86 million pounds a year", "Bats are meant to live in caves, but they aren\u2019t in this Australian holiday spot.\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s a natural disaster.

Locals say the bats are keeping tourists away and that they\u2019re hurting property prices.The government has pledged more than 2 million dollars to solve the problem. But because the species are native to Australia, they\u2019re listed as vulnerable and killing them isn\u2019t an option.Instead, the local council is looking at other ways to reduce their numbers. They\u2019re considering using smoke and noise to force the bats out.

The balloon ended up floating over the Port Phillip\u2019s Bay in the Australian state of Victoria after it ran low on fuel and wasn\u2019t able to land properly.\u201cWe just got up there and I think the wind just didn\u2019t really behave the way they were expecting and just couldn\u2019t quite get it to land so we drifted out over the bay.\u201dThere were fears the balloon could ditch into the ocean, but the passing boat saw it and made its way over. The pilot was then able to offload the passengers one at a time.\u201cLucky enough that just a couple of blokes on the bigger boat that we landed on just happen to see us coming down. So they followed us all the way out and did an awesome job of getting us all off safely \u2019cause that was the hard part \u2013 as soon as someone jumped out the balloon took off again. So it was sort of a bit of balancing act of getting people out yet not tipping it at the same time.\u201dOnce the passengers were safe, the balloon was light enough for the pilot to safely land on a beach. He\u2019s received a lot of praise for his actions.\u201cI think it was good on behalf of the pilot on the hot air balloon, as well because he kept calm. And that was the most important thing \u2013 just keeping everyone calm and we got everyone off the boat, off the hot air balloon onto the boat and then offloaded them to the Federal Police boat.\u201dNo one was hurt, but it wasn\u2019t the peaceful balloon trip the passengers were expecting", "It\u2019s like a scene from a Hollywood movie.

We\u2019ve offered Air Accident Investigation Board to support the investigation when it gets going.

First-time father, Mohinder Singh Gill, says they always planned to have a baby, but it all happened because of God\u2019s blessings.The man who oversaw the procedure said the couple came to the clinic 3 years ago for treatment because she wasn\u2019t able to get pregnant.

In comparison, these tremors measured 6.7 and 6.8 in magnitude according to the US geological survey.Visibly distressed, the footage shows Ecuadoreans in commotion and traffic stopping to a standstill.Unlike the devastating earthquake in April, this tremor only caused light injuries and one fatality for which the cause remains unclear. The tremors caused minor damage, mainly hitting infrastructure that had already been destroyed in the April disaster, which made nearly 29,000 Ecuadoreans homeless and claimed the lives of many.The fearful reaction seen in the footage shows the continued effects of the last earthquake on the people of Ecuador", "It\u2019s believed to be one of the Chile\u2019s worst environmental crises in recent years. This is the horrifying effect of a \u201cred tide\u201d, an outbreak of a deadly algal bloom.It\u2019s a naturally recurring phenomenon in southern Chile, turning sea water red and making seafood toxic, but the extent of this outbreak is unprecedented. Scientists say the El Nino weather pattern is a likely key factor, warming the ocean and creating bloom-friendly conditions.This expert says it\u2019s been called the Godzilla el Nino in the United States because it\u2019s thought to be one of the most intense in the last 100 years. He said we had an intense el Nino in 1982, \u201997, and in 2015, but this most recent one is more intense than its predecessors.The \u201cred tide\u201d has paralysed the local fishing industry, an important source of income for many coastal communities, and has sparked angry protests by fishermen who say the government hasn\u2019t provided enough compensation. Some are blaming the local salmon farming industry for exacerbating the problem, citing the dumping of dead fish by farmers in March.

However, coming in eighth in the contest and polling just over 1% of the vote it\u2019s safe to say London turned its back on Paul Golding before he turned his", "On your marks, get set, drone.A team drone relay race has taken place in Sussex. Teams of four raced first-person-view drones around a course complete with obstacles and tight hairpin curves. The pilots, wearing FPV headsets, were treated to a drone\u2019s-eye-view of the race, with a live feed linked between the cameras in their drones and their headsets.Spectators could also get a slice of the action, as monitors were set up by the course and headsets could be tuned in to the teams\u2019 frequencies.The drones, which can exceed speeds of 60 miles per hour, were raced in pairs in 10-minute heats, with points awarded for flying through obstacles.The sport appears to be increasing in popularity. Elsewhere, high-profile races like the World Drone Prix, held in March in Dubai, have taken the sport to a new level.

Two hundred and fifty are in captivity in the United States, 39 of which are now at this 200-acre centre.

Before you, ladies and gentlemen, is the largest haul of ivory and horn ever to be destroyed in this manner.

She also offered a mock prayer to Apollo, the old Greek God of light and music.\u201c\u2026 champion in artistic gymnastics.\u201dWhile holding an olive branch, she then lit the relay torch held by a Brazilian artistic gymnast. It\u2019ll now begin a six-day journey around Greece before heading to Brazil on May 3rd. There it will travel around 329 cities before ending at the opening of the Olympics in Rio on 5th August.\u201cThese Olympic Games will be a message of hope in troubled times. And the flame will carry this message into all corners of Brazil and indeed all the world.\u201dIt comes as Brazil faces difficult times as their President Dilma Rousseff faces impeachment. The crisis has paralysed the country\u2019s ability to revive its economy from recession. Added to that, preparations for the Games have been plagued with problems and a shortage of cash. Despite that, Thomas Bach, the International Olympic Committee President, had some positive words for the country:\u201cThe flame is an ancient symbol of peace and harmony, a symbol of the power of humanity to come together despite our differences.\u201dThis is the 80th anniversary of the torch relay. The first one took place ahead of the 1936 Olympic Games held in Berlin", "An explosion has ripped through a petrochemical plant on the southern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, sending a toxin-filled cloud into the air. At least 3 people are known to have died with more than 100 injured, including 58 workers.The blast happened at the Mexican national oil company Pemex in the Gulf state of Veracruz. The plant produces vinyl chloride, a hazardous industrial chemical that\u2019s used to make PVC pipes. The company has said the explosion, which sent a huge dark plume of smoke billowing upwards, happened in one of their top oil export hubs.Carlos Ruiz was working at the site and said the lights started to go off before there was a loud boom.A local hospital has put up a handwritten list of the injured being treated as worried family members arrived to check on their loved ones.Residents were told to stay indoors because of the possible toxic nature of the smoke. The cause is unclear. Several explosions have been reported at Pemex facilities in recent years", "Prince, one of the best-selling artists of all time, has died at the age of 57. His body was discovered at his Paisley Park home in Minnesota on Thursday morning.Just days earlier, his private jet had been forced to make an emergency landing in Illinois as a case of flu worsened. He was briefly hospitalised but appeared in concert the next day and told fans he was fine.He was born Prince Rogers Nelson and rose to fame in the mid 1970s. In his lifetime, he sold over 100 million records, won 7 Grammys, an Oscar and a Golden Globe.\u201cThis is very unbelievable. I could\u2019ve never imagined this in my wildest dreams.\u201dHe was widely acclaimed as one of the most inventive musicians of his era with songs \u201cPurple Rain\u201d, \u201cKiss\u201d and \u201cWhen Doves Cry\u201d among his biggest hits.It\u2019s another shock to the entertainment industry this year, and many other stars have taken to Twitter in shock and sadness. Samuel L. Jackson has tweeted he is shocked. Justin Timberlake said he\u2019s numb. Duran Duran tweeted they\u2019re devastated. And Katy Perry said, \u201cthe world\u2019s lost some magic.\u201d", "\u201cIn your estimation, what\u2019s the probability of finding intelligent alien life in the next 20 years and why?\u201d\u201cThe probability is low. Probably.\u201dWith his trademark sense of humour, physicist Stephen Hawking announced plans to search for alien life.\u201cBut the discoveries of the Kepler mission suggest that there are billions of habitable planets in our galaxy alone. And there are at least a hundred billion galaxies in the visible universe. So it seems likely that there are others out there.\u201dThey hope to deploy thousands of tiny light-propelled spacecraft into our nearest neighbouring star system, called Alpha Centauri, which is 25 trillion miles away.Scientists hope the vehicles, which are called Nanocraft, will be able to travel at 20% of the speed of light, which is more than a thousand times faster than current spacecraft. They\u2019ll be around the size of a postage stamp with a small sail but, despite their small size, they\u2019ll be able to carry cameras and communications equipment. That means they could send back pictures which will help to determine if the star system contains an Earth-like planets capable of sustaining life.But before they do that, the crafts would have to go through a difficult journey \u2013 first, surviving a launch from a larger spacecraft, then 20 years of travel through interstellar space where there are plenty of obstacles like dust collisions to dodge. It would then take 4 years for the pictures to transmit back to Earth. The project\u2019s called Breakthrough Starshot and could take years to develop ,and there\u2019s every chance it may not work. The 100-million-dollar initiative is being financed by billionaire Internet investor Yuri Milner. Last year he and Hawking announced a ten-year-long project called Breakthrough Listen. This involves monitoring radio signals for signs of intelligent life across the universe.\u201cToday, we commit to this next great leap into the cosmos because we are human and our nature is to fly.\u201d", "\u201cA few weeks ago, I had to take out all the baby teeth from a two-year-old child and that was heartbreaking, really heartbreaking.

And this is going to affect the child for the rest of their lives.\u201dRemoving baby teeth often leads to adult ones coming through crowded, meaning yet more chance of decay. New figures show at a cycle that more and more children are being caught in. Children\u2019s rotting teeth is costing the NHS 35 million pounds a year, up more than 60% from 5 years ago. As many as 14,000 children aged 5 and under needed to have teeth removed in 1 year.Caitlin is just one of these children. She needs to have 6 teeth removed. Her mother said she feels let down because she thought she was giving her healthy food.\u201cI was told off because I gave her too much fruit, which I thought was healthy, with sugar-free juice, and fruit snacks. It makes me feel ashamed in a way because I think people probably think, \u2018oh, she\u2019s been eating too many sweets, so you\u2019ve not been looking after her teeth.\u2019\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve seen much more processed food, much more drinking of fizzy drinks and drinks that purport to be healthy but actually have large amounts of sugar in them. And what we\u2019re saying is that parents need the information to be able to make really informed choices.\u201dThe hope is that with greater information will come better dental habits and end to a generation of young children requiring such extreme dental work", "Southwestern Japan has been hit by two major earthquakes, killing at least 9 people and injuring hundreds more.The initial magnitude 6.0 tremor struck 7 miles east of the city of Kumamoto at around 9:30 p.m. Another 6.4 magnitude quake hit the same place slightly after midnight.More than 44,000 people have been evacuated to schools and community centres. Many chose to spend the night outdoors despite the cold, waking up to cracked roads, crumbled houses and fallen roof tiles.While the magnitude was much lower than that of the 2011 quake that triggered a tsunami and nuclear meltdowns at Fukushima, the intensity was similar because the quake struck on land and at a much shallower depth.In this case, the absence of a tsunami and Japan\u2019s strict building codes helped keep the death toll down. Many iconic buildings like this one, Kumamoto castle, were badly damaged in the earthquake. Parts of the castle\u2019s signature stone walls collapsed in the aftermath.More than 3,000 troops, police and firemen were dispatched to the area from around Japan. Experts have warned more aftershocks could occur over the next week", "\u201cYou are demonstrating in a non-permitted area.

Without warning, the two planes carried out practice attacks on the warship in international waters in the Baltic Sea.\u201cIf you\u2019re the commander of the USS Donald Cook, you\u2019ve got to keep a really cool head. I think the commander should be commended in this case for doing so. But this isn\u2019t going to be the first time for this commander who\u2019s going to see a low-level flying aircraft coming at his warship because, to be honest with you, it\u2019s practised all the time.\u201dHowever, the White House have called it an act of aggression. The planes, which were carrying no visible weaponry, flew at about 30 feet (9 metres), creating waves in the water, passing by the ship 11 times in total.\u201cIt\u2019s just a game of cat and mouse and, actually, what\u2019s more important to the Russian jets, I would speculate, is to actually get a look at what the US Donald Cook is carrying in terms of its capability, its radar systems and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if actually had some sort of recon port on the Russian aircraft that was taking pictures.\u201dUS officials have said they tried to contact the Russian aircraft via the radio but received no response.A bilateral agreement between the US and Russia aimed at avoiding dangerous interactions at sea was signed in 1972.

The place that inspired \u201cHarry Potter\u201d and created millions of so-called Potterheads is hitting the auction block \u2013 and with a hefty price tag.Once owned by J.K. Rowling, it comes with a letter from the author explaining how sad she was to let it go. And valuers say the steep bidding price for the two together is worth every penny because of their importance in \u201cHarry Potter\u201d history.\u201cWell, as a chair it\u2019s probably not very exciting and, in fact, she said at that time that it was something you\u2019d pick up in a junk shop for a tenner, but it\u2019s really just a fact that she took the time to decorate it, and the fact that she actually wrote the books in it is important.But the fact that she took the time to decorate it and sign it and say, \u2018I wrote \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 in this chair\u2019, I think, is very important. There\u2019s not that many things in the \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 world that are especially valuable because her books became so popular so fast, and then they were published in huge editions so they\u2019re not that uncommon.\u201dAnd just in case it wasn\u2019t clear enough, the sides of the chair are inscribed by the author herself with, \u201cI wrote Harry Potter while sitting on this chair.\u201dThe live auction will be held at New York City\u2019s Waldorf Astoria Hotel and online for all the Potterheads out there who want to get their hands and their backsides on this significant seat", "\u201cYou\u2019re the one calling me \u2018Batman\u2019 when I just said that I\u2019m not gonna keep quiet due to your ignorance.

The experience is designed to give competition winners an exclusive behind-the-scenes glimpse into the world of sharks \u2013 how they live, why they\u2019re so misunderstood and their importance to the ocean\u2019s ecosystem.Do you think you\u2019d get a peaceful night\u2019s sleep?

Oh, and don\u2019t sleepwalk", "An effigy of Donald Trump spins and fizzes in the sky before finally\u2026 his head explodes.Perhaps not something many of us expected to see today, but it was all part of these Easter celebrations in Mexico City.The U.S. Republican front runner for the presidential nomination has sparked outrage south of the American border with his controversial anti-immigrant views and repeated attacks on the Mexican people.Burning effigies here are nothing new, but part of a widespread Mexican Holy Week tradition, where they\u2019re meant to represent Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus Christ, according to the Bible. But effigies are often modelled on unpopular political figures and few are more unpopular here than Donald Trump.Local resident Miguel Angel Tincono came out for the celebrations. He said the effigy was chosen because Mexicans were truly tired of the nonsense he speaks and are hoping he won\u2019t get elected president.Similar events are reported to have taken place across the country. They\u2019re thought to hold a symbolic function for uniting communities", "These aerials of Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef are evidence the most untouched part of it has the most severe bleaching in its history. The footage, which filmed over 500 coral reefs during six days from Cairns to Papua New Guinea, shows 95% is white and yellow.Scientists say the bleaching happens in rising water temperatures \u2013 the coral, under stress, drives out living algae, causing it to calcify, and part of that is down to the current El Ni\u00f1o climate cycle. They say unless the World Heritage Site gets a break in the weather conditions within weeks, some coral areas are unlikely to survive. But the World Meteorological Organisation says a break in temperatures is unlikely, as this year looks set to be the hottest on record.The Great Barrier Reef stretches 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometres) along Australia\u2019s northeast coast and is the world\u2019s largest living ecosystem. Last May, the World Heritage Committee stopped short of placing it on an \u201cin danger\u201d list but this latest find may raise long-term concerns about its future", "Taking off into the sky, these balloons filled with anti-Pyongyang messages were launched by South Korean protesters headed to North Korea.Three balloons carrying around 50,000 leaflets were released in the border city of Paju.

The leaflets also condemn North Korea\u2019s armed provocations against the Republic of Korea.\u201dTensions have been high on the Korean Peninsula since the North conducted a nuclear test in January and a long-ranged rocket launch in February, prompting the United Nations Security Council to issue new sanctions.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has recently been making official appearances in military drills and rocket engine testings which, if genuine, could indicate that an intercontinental ballistic missile is being developed", "For the first time in history, the Rolling Stones rocked Cuba. Watched by tens of thousands, Mick Jagger and co. kicked off with their hit \u201cJumping Jack Flash\u201d.It might only be rock and roll but the Cuban fans more than liked it. Fans started queuing for the concert 18 hours before the gates opened.

These worshippers can be seen running in a trance, mimicking the creatures that feature in their tattoos.Many believe that the tattoos, drawn by the monks inside, possess mystical powers. This man says that his tattoo is the reason he survived a car crash unscathed and why his job is going so well.The ink used is made of a mixture of snake venom, herbs, and cigarette ash and when the illustrations are complete, the monks blow on them in order to bestow them with their sacred power.The sanctity of the tattoos is apparently only maintained if the bearer obeys the five precepts of Buddhism, including abstinence from stealing, taking life, sexual misconduct, drinking alcohol, and taking drugs. If anyone does slip up though, they are welcomed back the next year for a top-up", "Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Well, it\u2019s actually quite hard to define.The Airlander\u2019s a cross between a plane, an airship, and a helicopter. And it\u2019s massive \u2013 as long as a football pitch and as tall as six double-decker buses. Small wonder it\u2019s been dubbed the biggest aircraft in the world.Today the Airlander made its debut flight in the UK, floating in a hangar at Cardington airport in Bedfordshire. The hybrid aircraft needs to clock up 200 hours of flying time before it\u2019s deemed airworthy by the Civil Aviation Authority and the European Aviation Safety Agency. But its makers, Hybrid Air Vehicles, believe it could be the aircraft of the future.They say that 25 million pound Airlander is capable of carrying heavier loads than a jumbo jet, while producing far less noise and emitting no pollution.

The Belgium fire service told the local media there were multiple fatalities and casualties and figures are expected to rise. Flights have been cancelled at the airport, which has been evacuated. Images of smoke coming from the Brussels metro station have also been circulating on social media.The metro system in Brussels has been closed as the city goes into lockdown, and the terror threat in Belgium has been raised to maximum level 4 across the country following the blasts.

Around 10 hours later, the rocket will separate and the probes will continue their journey towards Mars. If all goes to plan, that journey should take seven months, reaching the planet in October.Three days out from the edge of the Martian atmosphere, the two probes will separate. An entry, descent and landing demonstrator module known as Schiaparelli will drop towards the surface. There, it will test technology for future missions and make environmental observations for a short period of time before its batteries die.The Trace Gas Orbiter, meanwhile, will enter the planet\u2019s orbit, spending a year making manoeuvres to lower its altitude to 400 kilometres. By December 2017, it will be ready to begin analysing the make-up of the Martian atmosphere.

Mugabe had assured no one would starve as a result of a drought, which has left three million people in need and has prompted the declaration of a state of disaster and a plea for over a billion dollars in aid.And while many were in a festive mood for the occasion, Mugabe, accompanied by his wife Grace, used his birthday speech to attack western donors and gay rights.Mugabe is Zimbabwe\u2019s only leader since its independence from Britain in 1980.

Built with metal joints, the wreck is sturdier than other contemporary finds, leaving them free to raise it from the water without fears it would break apart.They encased the 20-metre by 8-metre boat in a specially constructed metal frame, raising all 40 tons from the water with the help of experienced divers.The delicate remains will be kept at the Newell and Heritage Centre in a specially designed station keeping it wet at all times.

Einstein told us space and time respond to matter within it, and just like the surface of a pond if you put your finger into a pond and move it, you create water waves. The same thing happens as mass moves through space-time; it creates ripples, those are the gravitational waves.We\u2019ve known about them nearly a hundred years, so one year or so after Einstein came up with his theory of general relativity, he discovered gravitational waves, but it\u2019s taken this long to actually detect them.As a gravitational wave passes through space and time, it changes the distance between two objects that are just freely sitting there in space and time, and so what LIGO and gravitational wave detectors try and do is to create objects that are suspended in such a way that they\u2019re free to move in some directions, and then when a gravitational wave moves past and changes the space and time, it actually changes the distance between these objects and then LIGO, for example, measures that distance change by bouncing a laser beam between these masses.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s really exciting is what comes next. Four hundred years ago, Galileo turned a telescope to the sky and opened the era of modern observational astronomy. I think we\u2019re doing something equally important here today. I think we\u2019re opening a window on the universe, a window of gravitational wave astronomy.\u201d\u201cIt is potentially possible, depending on how the universe started, that the echo from the very beginning, the earliest epoch in the universe may be detectable as a gravitational wave signal.

He says that the Russian President and chocolate share many attributes \u2013 they can both be soft and malleable or very hard.Around 70 kilograms of chocolate were needed to make the life-size sculpture. A first for Gusev, who\u2019d only ever made small sculptures of Stalin, Catherine the Great and Michael Jackson.Unfortunately, for the artist, Putin was too busy dealing with world affairs to sit for the sculpture, so he had to rely on studying photos of Vladimir at different angles instead.But chocolate Putin isn\u2019t alone \u2013 the sculptor also made a life-size model of his late labrador Connie to keep him company in his alternative confectionery reality.Those hoping to sink their teeth into the president may be disappointed \u2013 the festival organisers are offering the statue to its muse, so it remains to be seen whether the Russian president will be indulging in some chocolate Putin", "Fred is 35 years old and he is still single.One day a friend asks him, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you married?

Fourteen people were killed in the incidents.The deadliest attack took place at the Bataclan Concert Hall at around 11 p.m. when four gunmen stormed an Eagles of Death Metal concert. They began to fire indiscriminately into the crowd, throwing explosives as they went. One of the attackers reportedly shouted \u201cGod is great\u201d in Arabic during the massacre. Dozens of hostages were taken inside the venue. A short time, later security forces launched an assault on the theater. The two attackers were killed after detonating explosive belts. More than 80 concert goers died at the venue.Less than a mile away, eighteen diners at La Belle Equipe were shot dead during another attack. Five people were also killed in La Casa Nostra Pizzeria in the 11th arrondissement.Police say there were eight attackers in total. All of them are now dead. Seven are believed to have detonated suicide vests. These are the deadliest attacks in Europe since the 2004 Madrid bombings.Leaders across the world have condemned the attacks with US President Obama branding the incidents an attack on all humanity", "Bolivians have celebrated an ancient tradition rooted in indigenous practices where people adorn and honor skulls, called Natitas, which they believe bring them good fortune and protection.The Natitas spend most of the year indoors but are traditionally decorated and paraded to the cemetery a week after All Saints\u2019 Day. Friends and family adorn skulls with hats and flowers. They give them food and even cigarettes during the festivities. Even the skulls of unidentified deceased take part in the party. As the afternoon wore on, participants danced to honour the skulls.The Roman Catholic Church does not endorse the practice, but when the cemetery\u2019s parish refused to open its doors to the Day of the Skull believers twelve years ago, they threw stones at the church and broke all the windows. Now the parish is open to believers for a blessing ceremony.The Natitas tradition, a fusion of Catholic and indigenous beliefs, is traditionally practiced by the country\u2019s indigenous groups", "It happened in just under 3 seconds. After South African Police shot and killed a man after an apparent robbery, the CCTV video of the incident which took place near Johannesburg has been labelled as an \u201cexecution\u201d by local media.The man runs, falls, and lies on the floor. As the police officer approaches him, he pulls out his gun. We have decided not to show the moment of death, but just after this image, the officer aims, and fires.Even after he has been shot, another officer walks up to him and kicks him. After the kicking, he is still alive. And then another officer takes aim and shoots.Government figures released last month show South Africa\u2019s murder rate increased around 5% this year to nearly 50 per day.

A parade of bearded and moustached men took to the streets of New York to promote Saturday\u2019s 2015 National Beard and Moustache Championships. The facial hair festivity has been around since 1999 when its creator realised that America was underrepresented in international competitions.\u201cWe have 18 different categories and each category is pretty specifically defined, and so in order to compete in a particular category you have to meet the requirements for that category.

Authorities managed to safely return three of the long-finned whales back to the sea. However, by the time rescue teams arrived, six of them had already died. Fire crews sprayed the animals with water as they tried to save them. The last whale died as rescuers attempted to return it to the water.Officials say the pod were likely from the same family and the beaching may have followed the death of a dominant male.\u201cThe first big fact we can confirm is that there is a large dominant male which is dead and a female, roughly of the same age, which is also dead. Personally, I believe these animals were migrating. I think that the male or female, or both, died out at sea and all of the group drifted ashore at the same time.\u201dIt\u2019s the first time in thirty years that this number of whales has beached in the French region.Autopsies will be carried out at the University of Liege to determine the cause of death", "Capitalism, inequality, state intervention \u2013 all the reasons for this anti-capitalist Million Mask March.

Her parents refused to give up and Layla became the first person in the world to try an experimental new treatment.\u201cWe didn\u2019t see it as a tough decision. We saw it as the only decision. There was no other option. We didn\u2019t agree with going home to do nothing. We wanted to try it. We didn\u2019t want no what-ifs. We wanted to know we\u2019ve tried everything for her.\u201dThis designer cell treatment works by taking healthy donor cells and adding cancerous killing genes. To stop Layla\u2019s body attacking these genes, scientists remove DNA to make them invisible to her immune system. The treatment can then attack the leukaemia. Only one millilitre of this was injected into her body and the cancer appears to have been beaten.The pioneering treatment given to Layla was so new it\u2019d only ever been tested in the lab, but now it has to undergo full clinical trials to ensure it\u2019s suitable for wider patient use. It\u2019s not often treatments like this work first time and doctors say Layla\u2019s success is a big breakthrough.\u201cIt\u2019s not just leukaemias \u2013 maybe eventually, different sorts of cancers can be targeted in this way, but it does mean we have a new weapon, and it does mean therefore \u00a0that children like Layla who really are up against it now have something that we can do.\u201dAnd like Layla, many others may be able to fight back against one of the most common childhood cancers.\u201cShe\u2019s energetic, keeps us up late at night and gets us up early in the morning.

A nearby town has been devastated by mudslides, obstructing access to the region by officials. At least 45 people are still feared missing.Owned by Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP Billiton and the Brazilian company Vale, the dam was built to hold back water and residue from mining operations, a mixture that can often be toxic.Footage shows destroyed villages, derelict houses and abandoned cars tossed on their sides.Around 600 people are being evacuated to higher ground from Bento Rodrigues, a village about four miles beneath the dam that burst. Authorities said the flood had also reached another village further down the hill and that inhabitants there were also being evacuated.The dam\u2019s owner, Brazilian miner Samarco, said in a statement it hadn\u2019t yet determined why the dam burst or the extent of the disaster.

The green fireballs were seen in Thailand and Poland with witnesses capturing the incident from their cars.The shooting stars are part of the Taurid\u2019s meteor shower and are dubbed Halloween fireballs due to their occurrence in late October.The Thai Astronomical Society said the meteor seen from Bangkok could be identified as a fireball given its brightness. According to the Polish Fireball Network, the bolide, a term used by astronomers to refer to meteors that explode in the atmosphere, was spotted by many people across the country.The shower is an annual event, occurring between September and December, as the Earth travels through debris from the comet Encke. The meteors are said to be most visible through to the end of November with the possibility of spotting as many as a dozen per hour if conditions allow", "These children could be the first in generations to have a brother or sister. China has decided to end its decades-long one-child policy. All couples can now have two children as the country\u2019s ruling Communist party announced an ease of family planning restrictions.It\u2019s estimated that the controversial policy prevented about 400 million births since it began in 1979. It was enforced to reduce the country\u2019s birth rate, in turn slowing the rapid growth of population.Back in the 1950s, China\u2019s population was increasing by around 1.9% each year, after people were encouraged to have children to increase the workforce. But the government decided that this was unsustainable, resulting in the one-child policy. Those who flouted the rules were either fined, lost their jobs, or in some cases, mums were forced to abort their babies or be sterilised.Some desperate parents gave up their babies, leaving them is so-called baby hatches. It was for poor mums and dads who could not afford to keep their sick or disabled baby and saw parents simply place a child in the hatch, press an alarm button and then leave them behind to be taken care of by the state.Chinese families traditionally favour boys and so, if they can have only one child, some parents abandon girls and try again for a boy.Under the 2013 reform, couples in which one parent is an only child were allowed to have a second child.China\u2019s working age population continued to shrink in 2013, for the first time in decades, made worse by the one-child policy. The drop means that China could be the first country in the world to get old before it gets rich. Currently, there are no immediate details on the new policy or a time-frame for implementation", "A 32-year old man\u2019s been arrested in Berlin on suspicion of abducting a 4-year-old migrant boy after the body of a child was found in the boot of his car.

Mr Blair expressed regret over false intelligence suggesting the country had weapons of mass destruction, which was used as a justification for the action.He also admitted that those who removed Saddam Hussein, do bear some responsibility for the current situation in Iraq. But he said it was hard to apologise for removing the former leader as the country may have degenerated into civil war, much like Syria.Critics say the US decision to disband Saddam Hussein\u2019s army after the invasion created a huge security vacuum exploited by al Qaeda, eventually replaced by Islamic State.Mr Blair\u2019s comments come shortly before Sir John Chilcot is set to announce a timetable for completion of an investigation into the war.

The bleaching is caused by rising sea temperatures, which leads the coral to expel the tiny algae that give them their vivid colours. After it is expelled, the bright, white skeleton of the coral is left exposed.By the end of this year, the event is expected to impact approximately 38 per cent of the world\u2019s coral reefs and kill over 12,000 square kilometres. Although reefs represent less than 0.1 per cent of the world\u2019s ocean floor, they help support approximately 25 per cent of all marine species.The process is associated with El Ni\u00f1o \u2013 complex weather patterns which result in higher than normal ocean temperatures in large parts of the world. It is a phenomenon that has only occurred twice before in recorded history.The first was in 1998 in the Great Barrier Reef where up to 10 per cent of its corals died.The second in 2010 didn\u2019t affect the Great Barrier Reef, partly because two local cyclones helped to drive down ocean temperatures.But this year, bleaching has already been recorded across the northern Pacific, Indian, and western Atlantic Oceans.

These particles sometimes travel towards Earth, where they are captured by its magnetic field and guided towards the geomagnetic polar regions.On their way down, these particles are slowed down by Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which acts as a shield. The charged particles collide with gas molecules in the atmosphere and the energy released is given off as light which can be seen in the aurora.Under normal conditions, the northern oval lights cover Scandinavia, Greenland, Alaska, Canada and Russia and occasionally travel as far south as places like Minnesota", "A century after the original suffragettes made the headlines for their protest for women\u2019s rights, the same scenes are being replayed, but this time on the red carpet.Whilst the A-listers spoke to the media about the release of their new film, 10 women threw themselves onto the floor in London\u2019s Leicester Square.

They\u2019re hoping for clues on how to develop new generations of biofuel. While the genetic make-up of endangered pandas is carnivorous, the animals have adapted to a diet consisting almost exclusively of bamboo.\u201cSo it\u2019s a huge feat for this animal to digest something as hard. And also, they only eat certain parts of bamboo. They give them 30 kilograms of bamboo every day, and they eat maybe 10 kilograms. So if I have a piece of bamboo, you\u2019ll see certain parts are eaten and others are not, and we don\u2019t understand very well why.\u201dResearchers plan to study microorganisms in the animal\u2019s gut, before turning their attention to its digestive tracts.\u201cSo the prime reason we take the poo is we know that it\u2019s the bugs, the microorganisms living in the panda that digest all that tough food. So we\u2019re going to take the excrement, we\u2019re going to put that in the reactors and see how the digestion works.\u201dAccording to the team composed of Belgian, Italian and Chinese scientists, the toughness of bamboo stalks could be potentially helpful for studying the processing of fibrous material.The results may point to new, cheaper, ways to produce so-called second generation biofuels made from plants and biomass", "This was once the home of over 200 orangutans.

Measurements of the bones show that the creature had a curious blend of ancient ape and modern human-like features. Its brain is tiny, about the size of a gorilla\u2019s, and had small teeth. The feet and ankles are built for walking upright, but its hands are curved, a feature seen in apes that spend time in trees.Homo Naledi is unlike any primitive human found in Africa.

The procedure used a battery-powered wearable suitthat allows people to move their legs in a step-like fashion. The device is able to capture data to allow the scientists to see how much the subject is moving his or her own limbs or is being aided by the suit.The data collected on Pollock showed he was able to voluntarily assist the robot during stepping. According to UCLA, Pollock is the first person with complete paralysis to regain enough voluntary control to actively work the device. The researchers said that they do not describe Pollock\u2019s achievement as \u201cwalking\u201d because without the robotic device and spinal stimulation, no paralysed person has ever independently walked", "A group of several hundred migrants decided to walk from Budapest to try to get to Austria.They walked on a national road about 20 km outside of Budapest, chanting, \u201cWe want bus,\u201d watched by local police.

Authorities said that later in the evening, the emissions died down, containing primarily vapour and some ash.The town of San Rafael lies 45 kilometres north of the volcano and some residents here gathered outside to watch the impressive sight.The volcano is located around 31 miles (50 kilometres) south of Quito. Its snow-topped symmetrical cone which rises to nearly 6,000 meters is visible from the capital on a clear day.Authorities haven\u2019t ordered mandatory evacuations but have declared a state of emergency and are monitoring the situation closely. The last recorded eruption of this volcano was 75 years ago in 1940", "A historic moment at the US Army Ranger School after two women became the first to wear the tab of a US Army ranger. Kristen Griest and Shaye Haver were the only two women to complete the gruelling 62-day course which included parachute jumps, helicopter assault and swamp survival.\u201cFor me, really, I think, the swamps both in Darby and Florida were just frustrating. You\u2019re going through at night. You\u2019re either cold or extremely hot, one or the other\u2026 And you are walking under night vision for hours on end, you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to end, tripping over things\u2026\u201dOnly they and 94 men completed the training which began with 19 women and 381 men.It was the first time women had been allowed to participate.\u201cI was skeptical if they could handle it physically. Shaye was the only one who volunteered to take the weight. She took the weight off me. She carried it the last half of that rock, literally saving me. I probably wouldn\u2019t be sitting here if it wasn\u2019t for Shaye.\u201cBut the men praised the women for their dependability and Griest received a special mention for her land navigation skills.The women acknowledged they had initial concerns that their gender might have been an issue for some of their fellow soldiers. Surpassing all doubts, both Griest and Haver said the way to make it through ranger school is intense physical and mental conditioning", "As they collect thousands of dead fish, the question being asked is how did they die? Nearly 50 tonnes of dead fish have been removed by residents at the Cajititlan Lake in Mexico. The discharge of waste from treatment plants into the freshwater lake is thought to be the cause.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to submit recommendations in the coming days regarding the fundamentally inadequate use of or operations of wastewater treatment plants around the lake which resulted in the lack of oxygen for the fish.\u201dLocal authorities had originally blamed the so-called \u201cnatural cycle\u201d of the fish locally known as papocha for the mass deaths. But authorities told the media the deaths were very likely caused by man-made contamination.\u201cThere have been a significant number of deaths, but I insist that the deaths are due to a lack of oxygen caused by the wastewater in the lake.\u201dPossible fines could be levied on the commercial plants around the lake if they are found guilty of not properly managing their waste disposal", "If suspected of carrying drugs to smuggle out of Peru, the military now has permission to shoot down the aircrafts. The country\u2019s Congress unanimously passed the legislation in an effort to clamp down on flights carrying cocaine.According to the United States, Peru is the world\u2019s top cocaine producer, and it\u2019s estimated most of the country\u2019s cocaine is sent abroad in small planes. The US State Department estimates that small planes moved 180 tonnes of cocaine from Peru in 2014.Congressman Carlos Tubino said Peru can\u2019t allow traffickers to continue to defy its laws. He puts the number of narcotics flights at 600 per year.But the control of drugs trafficking isn\u2019t a simple task. And though measures have been taken to stop the so-called drugs flights, cocaine also leaves the country on boats, in suitcases and in the stomachs of drugs smugglers on commercial flights", "Russian President Vladimir Putin took a dive underwater in Crimea.

Nearly half of those who lost their lives in the blast were foreigners.Thai authorities say they\u2019re now looking for a suspect seen on CCTV footage near the famous shrine where the blast took place.No one has yet claimed responsibility, but it\u2019s this man in the yellow shirt who is now the focus of police interest.

The announcement of \u201cStar Wars\u201d lands, made by Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger comes as fans gear up for the December release of \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d, the opening film in a new \u201cStar Wars\u201d trilogy.The 14-acre lands at Anaheim and Orlando will introduce a new planet from the intergalactic film saga. The project will feature two new rides, including one where participants take control of the Millennium Falcon spaceship, as well as the Cantina, the infamous hub of rogue smugglers and traders in the films.Speaking at the the Disney fan convention, D23 Expo, director of \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d, J.J. Abrams, said he couldn\u2019t imagine a Star Wars land without the Millennium Falcon.\u201cWell, you know I think that Bob nailed it by having, by announcing a Millennium Falcon experience because as much as we could all name a bunch of things and places we\u2019d like to go and things we\u2019d like to see, the Falcon is, I think even more than the lightsaber, maybe the most iconic piece of hardware in the Star Wars universe, and so I think it would be hard to imagine a Star Wars land that didn\u2019t have something that involved the flight of the Falcon.\u201dConstruction of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d will begin at Disneyland in California in 2017, while a start date for Disney World in Florida hasn\u2019t been set yet.Disney didn\u2019t comment on costs but the company spent 1 billion dollars to build a 12-acre Cars Land that debuted in California in 2012 and now will open a 5.5 billion dollar theme park in Shanghai next year", "Arriving in Havana today, US Secretary of State John Kerry became the first chief of American diplomacy to visit Cuba in 70 years.

It comes after a change in wind direction prompted fears that toxic chemical particles could be blown inland, police confirming for the first time the presence of deadly sodium cyanide at the site.The explosions late on Wednesday originated in a warehouse storing toxic chemicals and some residents have expressed concern that the air and water could have been poisoned.About 6,300 people have been displaced by the blasts, while 33 people remain in a serious condition in hospital", "It looks like a massive kids\u2019 play park, but the reason for these black plastic balls has nothing to do with fun. The Las Virgenes County water district in Los Angeles has decided to put the balls on top of the water to block the sunlight from hitting it. The so-called shade balls are the brainchild of David Pedersen.\u201cThe balls, really, they\u2019re intended for three reasons: they help to cut down on evaporation, that\u2019s helped us save water; and then it also helps to prevent algae from growing in the reservoir, so it improves our water quality; and then finally as a side benefit, it helps keep the birds off the surface and birds do their thing and that causes a problem.\u201dThis week, the mayor of Los Angeles released 20 thousand black balls into the Los Angeles reservoir.California is in its fourth year of a catastrophic drought that has led the state to issue a series of steps to reduce water consumption.The shade balls work for two decades.

It was not immediately clear what had sparked the violence. Once calm had returned, police ushered yet more migrants into the stadium, packing the stands.The scuffles took place a day after a police officer on the island was suspended for brandishing a knife and slapping a man identified by Greek media as a Pakistani migrant.The situation appeared calmer today as police with riot shields lined fences around the stadium and migrants queued to be registered.Local authorities are responsible for the registration process, but migrants complain that they are understaffed, too slow and that there was no food or protection from the heat in the stadium. The migrants arriving in cars have come back crossing the sea in rubber dinghies from Turkey in a bid to enter the European Union.

The narcotics unloaded at the US naval base at San Diego are among the largest haul from a single Coast Guard mission.The 32 tons of pure uncut cocaine would have been enough to produce street sales of the drug roughly equivalent to 33 million lines.Coast Guard anti-smuggling operations have netted 59 tons of narcotics off the shores of Mexico and Central America during the past year \u2013 more than were seized during the three previous years combined.

For instance, the design of this model is centred around the panorama of the Moscow skyline and the name of President Putin and the artistically reproduced signature of the president. Because in our world we live in, the President of the Russian Federation is a true symbol of our strong independent country, so his image can be used as the real symbol of our times.\u201dThe company has somewhat of a track record in Putin paraphernalia.

It was packed by survivors\u2019 accounts, with about 600 people. These are boats that should only have about 30 or 40 or 50 on board, not 600, so obviously the people were stuffed down into the hull, shoulder to shoulder, feet to feet in every nook and cranny, so much that when a rescue boat approached, people became anxious and excited and tipped the boat over so that it capsized, and according to people on the rescue boat, it sank within minutes.At least 400 have been rescued \u2013 unfortunately, 25 so far dead.

Well, stop right there because this year it means the end of July.For the second time this month, the moon is about to become full. There was one on the 2nd \u00a0of July and now a second is coming on July 31st.According to modern folklore, when there are two full moons in a month, the second one is blue. Most blue moons look pale grey and white just like the moon you see on any other night. Simply squeezing a second full moon into a calendar month doesn\u2019t exactly change its colour.Nevertheless, on rare occasions, the moon can turn blue. According to NASA, a truly blue moon usually requires a volcanic eruption. It says back in 1883, for example, people saw blue moons almost every night after the Indonesian volcano Krakatoa exploded. Some of the plumes of ash were apparently filled with particles that were one micron wide, about the same as the wavelength of red light.Particles of this size strongly scatter red light whilst allowing blue light to pass through. Krakatoa\u2019s clouds then acted like a blue filter. This was also the case with the number of other eruptions, and forest fires can do the same trick.On the other hand, though, tomorrow\u2019s moon could turn red. Often, when the moon is low, it looks red for the same reason that sunsets are red. NASA explains that the atmosphere is full of aerosols much smaller than the ones injected by volcanoes. These aerosols scatter blue light whilst leaving the red behind", "A US dentist who killed a lion in Zimbabwe says he regrets shooting the well-known animal.In a written statement, Walter Palmer insists that he thought he was on a legal hunt and that he \u201cdeeply regrets\u201d his actions.Cecil the lion, known for his black mane, was about 13 years old, and a famous attraction for wildlife tourists in Zimbabwe.

The proper market value for this lion, which is a big treasure, would be around $100,000 US dollars.\u201dPolice in Zimbabwe say two people have been arrested and that Mr Palmer may also face poaching charges. If convicted, the two men would be required to pay $20,000 in compensation, but the court may impose an additional jail term.According to the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, investigations show that the killing of Cecil was illegal because the land owner was not allocated a lion on his hunting quota for 2015.Lions are not a protected species in Zimbabwe. The country issues annual permits allowing foreign hunters to kill wildlife like elephant, buffalo and lion, and say doing so allows it to raise money for conservation", "Could this unknown piece of material lead to answers? French investigators are looking into what appears to be debris from a plane that has washed up on Reunion Island.Aviation experts have said the debris looks like a wing component from a 777 plane known as a flaperon.It\u2019s too early to suggest it may be from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. That flight is believed to have crashed into the Indian Ocean and has been missing since March last year. There have been other plane crashes much closer to Reunion, but flight MH370 is the only Boeing 777 to have disappeared in the area.The Malaysian Airlines plane was traveling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. The journey should have taken six hours and lost connection with air traffic controllers mid-flight.The two-metre-long piece of wreckage washed up on the island about 370 miles (595 kilometres) east of Madagascar. Malaysian officials have sent a team to the islandsto work alongside French air transport officials to examine whether the wreckage discovered is from the missing Malaysian Airlines flights.

In fact, last summer, part of the bridge collapsed onto the walkway.The city\u2019s government recently issued a statement to say the padlocks spoiled the aesthetics of the bridge and underlined the potential risk for additional railing collapses.

The archaeologists have dismissed Bormann\u2019s residency as untrue, saying DNA tests on a skeleton found in Berlin proved that he committed suicide there and never even arrived in South America.Three separate buildings with notably different structures to those common in the area at the time, in addition to German coins and a piece of a German porcelain plate from the mid-twentieth century, were found amongst the ruins.Investigators believe that while Bormann never lived there, it was in fact built as a potential refuge for high-ranking Nazis fleeing Germany at the end or near the end of World War II. They claim the remote border location made it an ideal refuge for those eluding authorities but explained that Nazis probably never ended up using the hideout, since they could live freely in Argentine towns and cities following the war", "Burger King restaurants in Japan have released a unisex fragrance on April Fools\u2019 Day which they\u2019ve called \u201cFlame-Grilled\u201d.\u201cYum. No Whopper, no wife.\u201d\u201cYou smell sexy, just like Whopper.\u201dYeah, apparently, it\u2019s not a joke either \u2013 the perfume was made over six months and it\u2019ll cost you 28 pounds. But, fear not, you do get a free Whopper with it.The company\u2019s brand manager in Japan, Kana, said the fragrance should appeal to both men and women.\u201cWe want women who like meat to wear this, and men who want to smell sexy and wild should definitely wear it, as well.\u201dThe fast food chain is selling 1,000 bottles of this spicy scent for one day only across its Japanese branches", "A gorilla in Israel Safari zoo came to the rescue of her younger sister yesterday after she fell into a five-metre moat. A passing visitor filmed the three-year-old gorilla named Amelia falling into the ditch.Her eight-year-old sister Ania then carried her on her back, attempting to climb up the moat wall but was scared off by a power cable and fell down.The zoo spokesman said the pair then successfully climbed up the other side of the moat onto the visitor\u2019s area which was evacuated by the zoo staff.After Amelia recovered, all gorillas who are kept at the night house were released back into their open yard", "A terrifying ordeal for two window cleaners in China, as the platform they were working on began swinging violently and smashing into the building.The incident, which took place outside the 91st floor of the Shanghai World Financial Centre, lasted for 15 minutes with their cradle slamming into a wall at one point, sending glass flying into the building and down to the ground.While the exact cause of the incident is not known, the two men were eventually winched to safety and taken to hospital where they were treated for minor injuries. An investigation is now under way", "It is known as the world\u2019s deadliest walkway, and it\u2019s set to reopen to the public this week, after undergoing years of repair work to fix deteriorating pathways. Officially known as Caminito del Rey, the narrow walkway is located on the steep walls of a gorge in Ardales near Malaga in Spain.It\u2019s been partially closed since 2001 when authorities decided to shut the entrances after 5 people fell to their deaths in less than two years.Over the years, Caminito del Rey has earned a deadly reputation and has become a hot spot for risk-takers. It\u2019s a famously treacherous path built high above the Guadalhorce River and was opened by King Alfonso XIII in 1921.After an extensive refurbishment, the three-foot-wide (0.9 metres) pathway which hangs over 100 feet (30 metres) above the ground will open on March 28th. Some adventurers, though, might be a little disappointed to find out that the new Caminito del Rey is much safer after its renovation. It now has new safety features, including handrails, wood-paneled paths and the skywalk", "Tens of thousands of people braved heavy rain, lining the streets Singapore, to catch a glimpse of the coffin of founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew as his funeral procession wound through the country he helped build.The procession carrying Lee, who died on Monday March 23rd aged 91, will pass through Tanjong Pagar, the constituency he represented for 60 years before continuing its 15.4-kilometre journey to the funeral ceremony at the National University of Singapore.Singaporeans, many dressed in the mourning colours of black and white, waited for hours to watch the procession, chanting \u201cLee Kuan Yew\u201d as it passed. Rain started pouring minutes before the funeral procession started but that didn\u2019t discourage spectators.\u201cI guess maybe this rain that it\u2019s a good sign, I suppose, you know. Everyone is together here. It is very sad at the moment, but rejoicing, I suppose, and giving thanks to everything that he\u2019s done for us.\u201dLee had receded from public and political life of the past few years but was still seen as an influential figure in the government.He ruled Singapore from 1959 to 1990 and is credited with transforming the tiny island nation from a poor British colonial trading port into one of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries", "The lights went out in parts of Japan, Hong Kong and the Philippines today as part of Earth Hour \u2013 a climate change awareness campaign spanning cities around the world, encouraging people to switch off all non-essential lights between 8:30 and 9:30 p.m. local time on the last Saturday of March.In Japan, the capital city\u2019s iconic Tokyo Tower was plunged into darkness to mark WWF\u2019s Earth Hour. Earth Hour began in Sydney in 2007, asking households and businesses to switch off their lights for 60 minutes to curb down global carbon pollution and promote climate change awareness. And it now spans more than 7,000 cities worldwide.Elsewhere in Hong Kong, around 4,000 businesses, buildings and schools turned off their lights to mark Earth Hour. Hong Kong\u2019s WWF chairman Edward Ho said that taking part in last year\u2019s event showed that by simply dimming the lights for one hour, Hong Kong\u2019s energy consumption was reduced by more than four per cent, avoiding the emission of 153 tons of carbon dioxide", "Could it be the cleanest country in the world? Costa Rica has managed to achieve a clean energy milestone by using only renewable energy for the first 75 days of the year, which is a record for any country.Thanks to heavy rainfall this year, its hydroelectric plants alone are generating almost enough electricity to power the entire country. With a boost from geothermal, solar, and wind energy sources, Costa Rica doesn\u2019t need any coal or petroleum to keep the lights on. No fossil fuels have been burnt to generate electricity since December last year.Costa Rica is known for its clean energy policies. Of course, though, the country does have a lot of things going in its favour. It\u2019s a pretty small nation of less than 5 million people. It doesn\u2019t have much of a manufacturing industry, which would require a lot of energy. Its economy relies on tourism and agriculture, particularly bananas and coffee. And it\u2019s filled with volcanoes and lots of other things that lend themselves to renewable energy \u2013 its tropical climate with high rainfall and mountainous interior.Costa Rica has a goal of being carbon neutral by 2021. New geothermal projects are already said to be in the planning stages to ensure that the country doesn\u2019t have to rely on fossil fuels in the future. The Central American state\u2019s government approved a 958-million-dollar geothermal project last year.Geothermal energy is basically the heat from the earth. Resources of geothermal energy range from the shallow grounds to hot water and hot rock found a few miles beneath the earth\u2019s surface. The first plant, when completed, is expected to make 55 megawatts of electricity, which is enough to power 55,000 homes. And there are plans for a further two 50 megawatts plants to be built nearby. You may be thinking a 958 million dollar project is a lot of money, but reportedly, Costa Rica hasn\u2019t had a military since 1948, so while saving money on defence, it\u2019s got lots left over to spend on projects like this", "If you live in America, you could soon own a personal handheld flamethrower. American company Ion Productions, which says it designs entertainment software and innovative devices, is looking for funding to help it produce the XM42. The company says it will be the world\u2019s first commercially available handheld flamethrower.Though they might easily be considered pretty dangerous weapons, the XM42 is actually considered to be legal in 48 US states. Only California and Maryland have laws regulating them. The XM42 shoots metres of fire and can be yours for just 699 dollars, which is around 469 pounds.While some may question the possible uses of a device that shoots out a stream of 25 feet (7.6 metres) of burning petrol, Ion suggests melting snow, burning insects, and getting rid of garden weeds, to name a few. The company has said it strongly encourages users to only use the flamethrower away from others and away from anything that could be accidentally set on fire.The XM42 is only at the development stage at the moment, and Ion is looking for funding from website Indiegogo to help it get through to production", "Two bottlenose dolphins have been rescued from a lake in Western Australia after swimming up a river, possibly chasing fish. Kayakers herded the dolphins towards the lakeside with one even throwing himself on the animal to try to catch it and bring it to safety. Marine rangers then secured the dolphins by placing them on sheets. A total of 10 people lifted one of the dolphins, which weighed over 300 kilograms.Rescuers then kept the dolphins hydrated as they were transported to deeper water. The dolphins were released in the lower reaches of the Serpentine River in the Western Australian city of Mandurah. The male dolphins were healthy but tired after swimming in shallow lake water which prevented them from navigating into deeper water.The rescue operations caught the attention of a group of local residents who cheered as the dolphins were successfully released in the water", "A Polish mountain biker has broken his own world record by cycling up 3,139 steps at the Taipei 101 tower. It took Kristian Herba 2 hours and 30 minutes to complete the challenge.The 33-year-old teacher surpassed his previous record of last year when he climbed 2,919 steps up a tower in Melbourne. But he\u2019s still waiting for confirmation of the new record by the Guinness World Record authorities.Taipei 101 was formerly the tallest building in the world before the Burj Khalifa in Dubai took the title \u2013 it\u2019s more than 500 meters taller", "This aerial footage shows the scene in the French Alps where a Germanwings flight crashed this morning, killing all of those on board. Debris can be seen strewn over an area of hundreds of metres, as rescuers work to try to recover bodies. The flight from Barcelona to D\u00fcsseldorf went down at around 11 a.m. local time and authorities say none of the 144 passengers and six crew could have survived.Among the passengers were 16 school children and two teachers from a German school. The students were in the 10th grade and had been taking part in an exchange programme in Spain. It\u2019s also thought that two babies were on board the flight.Crisis centres have now been setup as distressed relatives of the passengers arrived at airports in Spain and Germany to try to find out more information about what happened to their loved ones.Lufthansa, which owns the Germanwings airline, says it believes the crash was an accident rather than foul play, but it\u2019s still working to establish the exact cause. The airline believes there were 67 Germans on the flight, while Spain\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister said 45 passengers had Spanish names. One Belgian was also on board. French police at the crash site say it could take days to recover the bodies due to difficult terrain, snow and incoming storms", "The hat which French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte wore during the Battle of Waterloo is on its way back to the battlefield which saw his demise.The two-cornered, or bicorne hat, is normally kept in a museum in Sens in east of Paris.It was the one Napoleon wore on June 18th, 1815 when he was defeated by the British forces commanded by the Duke of Wellington and General Von Bl\u00fccher\u2019s Prussian army.Specialised transporters prepared tailor-made boxes to take the precious hat to Wellington Museum in the Belgian town of Waterloo where it will stay for four months.\u201cThis one is the last one he wore because it\u2019s the one he had during the Battle of Waterloo. And, as it was a rainy day, it changed its shape and you can still see traces on the front of raindrops which tell us about the rain which was falling from the Belgian sky.\u201dOne of the emperor\u2019s uniforms was also sent to Waterloo ahead of the bicentenary commemorations.Napoleon, initially defeated in 1813, had escaped exile in the Mediterranean island of Elba and returned to power for a period now called the Hundred Days. After Waterloo, he was confined on the Atlantic island of Saint Helena until his death in 1821", "A few lucky visitors got a rare glimpse of these baby White Tigers, as they received their first vaccination at a zoo in Hungary. The Bengal cubs, who haven\u2019t been formally named yet, were born two months ago but had to be separated from their mother, as she refused to take care of them shortly after their birth.The zoo doctor could be seen giving them a thorough examination and administering their first vaccination as well as feeding them tablets to prevent worms.The cubs, who are thought to be female, are developing well with the close attention of the zoo keepers who bottle-feed them and give them small amounts of meat.

This is a 56-page notebook written by Turing in 1942. And in April, it\u2019s being auctioned in New York. This week, it was previewed in Hong Kong.\u201cThe manuscript is the most extensive known manuscript done by Alan Turing, who\u2019s known as the father of computing. He\u2019s also the man who broke the Nazi Enigma code during World War II. There are no other manuscripts by him in private hands. There\u2019s never been one to sell at market. It\u2019s almost 100% sure that there will not be another one.\u201dAlso being sold is a three-rotor Enigma enciphering machine, the same model Turing helped to break.\u201cIt\u2019s an original World War II German Enigma machine, so it is the enciphering machine that the Nazis used to encode secret messages to send to each other, you know, describing which U-boat to bomb for example\u2026 And it is this very machine, not this specific one, but this model, that Alan Turing was working to break the code for.\u201dAlan Turing was recently played by Benedict Cumberbatch in \u201cThe Imitation Game,\u201d a film that reflected the way he was treated during his life. He never received credit for his work during the war and committed suicide in 1954. At the time, he was receiving hormone treatment after being charged with homosexuality, which was then a crime. He was eventually pardoned sixty years later.The notebook being sold in New York was actually left to his friend Robin Gandhi. He kept it hidden until his death in 1995", "The San Diego Zoo is taking care of a couple of new residents in the form of two very rare, but rather strange-looking pelicans. The Dalmatian Pelican chicks were born at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, but their parents were unable to raise them, so they will be looked after by the Avian Propagation Centre until they\u2019re old enough to return to the safari park, but the new guests seem pretty low-maintenance.\u201cBy day two, they\u2019re already feeding themselves. So basically, we just keep them in a climate-controlled brooder where they\u2019re kept warm and moist. And then we feed them.

The Teremok Orphanage is home to 21 preschool children and director Raisa Prilipko says they face not only physical but psychological risks as well.\u201cThey know what a missile complex is. They all understand what this is. They heard it here when the walls were trembling especially in January and February \u2013 before there was a ceasefire.

Well, the kind of miniature drones the laser targets are ones that are now widely available on the consumer market. This is because small, unmanned drones are cheap, quite easy to launch, and in essence are the perfect weapon for terrorists and spies.So how does the laser work? Well, according to a report in the English language China Daily, the laser can hit a drone travelling below 1,600 feet (488 metres) at a speed of up to 110 miles per hour (177 kph), after locating it within five seconds.Developed by the China Academy of Engineering Physics, it claims the laser has a 100 percent success rate, after shooting down more than 30 drones in a recent test, providing better accuracy than snipers and helicopters.They added that the new laser system would be installed or transported in vehicles and is expected to play a key role in securing urban events.According to the state media, the Defence Agency is now developing a larger, more powerful version of its laser with a greater range, allowing the government to increasingly rely on unmanned vehicles", "The drummer for the rock band AC/DC has appeared in court in New Zealand, charged with drug possession and attempting to arrange the murders of two people.Phil Rudd appeared in court in the North Island city of Tauranga after police raided his home on Thursday.The 60-year-old entered no plea to the charges and was remanded on bail with no restrictions on his movements.

The Big Bang, that today is considered to be the origin of the world, does not contradict the creative intervention of God; on the contrary it requires it. Evolution in nature is not in contrast with the notion of divine creation because evolution requires the creation of the beings that evolve.\u201dThe Pope\u2019s remarks were in line with the Catholic Church\u2019s teaching for the last few decades", "A skatepark in London has become the first in Europe to receive heritage status.Known as the Rom Skatepark, it first opened in East London in 1978 and is now listed with the same protection usually given to historical buildings, such as the Houses of Parliament or Westminster.The English Heritage Body which awards buildings their listed status said the park was recognised for its cultural significance.\u201cIt is unusual. It\u2019s the first skatepark that\u2019s been listed actually in Europe, so it\u2019s really quite unusual but special as well, and that\u2019s why we have recommended it for listing.It\u2019s not about getting hip, it\u2019s about recognising what\u2019s special nationally, and this is to say, modern, but this is part of our sporting heritage and requires that recognition in the same way that say Lords or Wimbledon has.

You have to ask why you can get arrested just for dancing. We thought that this was a problem, and so we had a large number of people give their signatures to remove dancing from the nightlife laws and stop regulating dancing.\u201dBut the new law comes with restrictions: bars and clubs will have to obtain a permit if they want to allow dancing into the early hours, and they must adhere to new lighting requirements.Lights in clubs must now be brighter than 10 lux or similar to a theatre before the main show starts. Officials say this is because they hope brighter lighting will help prevent crimes and misbehaviour.So although Japanese clubbers may now be dancing in bright light rather than the moonlight, it seems the country is definitely getting its groove back", "It\u2019s underwater pumpkin carving like you\u2019ve never seen it before, unless you have, then it\u2019s pretty much the same thing.

This is the supermoon, this is the largest full moon of the calendar year. The full moon that occurred in July and the full moon that will occur in September are also going to be large, but not as large as this one, so they\u2019ve been called the supermoon, although by the strict definition there\u2019s only one per year.

Most found in the wild are between 60-70 centimetres, according to Japanese environment agency data.

Footage broadcast by the country\u2019s state-run television showed Kim walking into the centre of a large stage with a limp, in front of a huge portrait of his grandfather emblazoned onto a red flag.Speeches by government officials were heard during the memorial service for founding president Kim Il Sung, who died 20 years ago today. State-produced media and propaganda is highly controlled and choreographed by the isolated country and any defects with its leadership are usually kept a tightly guarded secret. Kim Il Sung, who founded the country and ruled until his death, had a large tennis-ball sized growth on the back of his neck which meant state propagandists were forbidden from filming him from certain angles. It\u2019s not clear why Kim Jong Un had developed the limp, but state media has shown the young leader, in his early 30s, conducting military spot guidance visits on the east and west coasts of North Korea in recent weeks", "If you\u2019ve got a fear of spiders, look away now, as scientists have brought ancient spiders back to life using 3D graphics.Using well-preserved fossils, researchers from the University of Manchester and a museum in Berlin worked out how the extinct early relative of spiders would have moved.The spider-like creatures, known as Trigonotarbid, would have lived 410 million years ago. They were some of the first predators to dominate on land, meaning they would have been at the top of the food chain.Scientists who studied the ancient fossils were able to see their leg joints and work out a range of motion in the limbs. Researchers used an open-source computer graphic program to create the video showing how the creatures walked.They reckon the spiders\u2019 prey would have been early flightless insects and say they would vomit digested enzymes on their prey and then suck up the liquid as food.
