A professor says the flamingo's hip and leg bones help it stand on one leg. The bones help the bird balance. Flamingos do not have to use their muscles a lot to stand on one leg.Another researcher said the flamingo is unusual. Humans cannot stand on one leg, even for one hour. Even when we stand still, we're moving all the time because our muscles work so we don't fall over. Flamingos do not use many muscles to stand on one leg, so they save energy. Other birds also stand on one leg.", "Germany has the first female referee in Europe's top leagues. Her name is Bibiana Steinhaus. She is very happy.

A social media user said: \"This is a really good idea.\" The amount of toilet paper used is down by 20%.", "Everyone's nose is a different shape. Researchers may know why. Researchers say it could be because of the climate. People with wider noses live in warm, humid areas. People with narrower noses live in colder, drier places. The nose makes sure the air we breathe is warm enough. It is like a temperature controller.Researchers looked at the noses of over 2,600 Africans, Asians and Europeans. They checked their nose width and height, and the distance between the nostrils. The research could help people with the heat or cold, and the humidity if they go to other countries. It is difficult to know how our nose will change shape in the future.", "The man who made the Internet is worried. He said people are using the web in dangerous ways. Firstly, companies are making fake news to fool people. This \"spreads like wildfire\". The second danger is political adverts. They can stop people from voting.

TRAPPIST-1 is a very small sun with seven Earth-sized planets. NASA said three of the planets get heat like the Earth, so life could exist. TRAPPIST-1 is nearly 40 light-years away from Earth. Its sun is not very bright.NASA said you could see the other TRAPPIST-1 planets if you were on any of them. They would not look small. They would look bigger than our Moon. You would see things on them. A scientist said life can live in very hot caves and at the bottom of the ocean where there is no light. She said life could be on the TRAPPIST-1 planets.", "Pop music is back on Bulgarian radio. For two months, there was only 70-year-old classical or folk music, recorded before World War II. Copyright meant the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) could not play pop music. BNR said it would pay more royalties. This is the money singers get every time a radio station plays their songs. In the past two months, the number of listeners to BNR went up by 20%. Perhaps people like older music like Bulgarian folk songs, classical music and pre-war jazz more than Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. The boss of BNR said there could be new radio stations with different types of music.", "Scientists did tests on mice. They showed that fasting can be healthy. Fasting is eating little or nothing for a day or two. It can help diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The scientists gave the mice low-calorie food for four days. Then the mice had 10% of their normal food for three days. This helped the pancreas in the mice.The pancreas makes insulin in our body. Insulin breaks down sugar in the blood.

They now want to do the tests on humans.", "Is getting ketchup out the bottle difficult? Does the last bit of toothpaste stay in the tube? Does jam stick to the side of the jar? There is now an answer to these problems. Scientists made a very slippery surface for bottles, tubes and jars. Things like glue, paint and cosmetics slide out like water. This will make you a little richer.Scientists from LiquiGlide made the surface to cut waste and save money. Millions of litres of ketchup, sauces, paint, gels and creams stay in containers. They are thrown away. The new surface will cut this waste. It is part of the zero-waste economy. LiquiGlide said the surface is important and helpful, like the wheel.", "There used to be nine planets, but now there are eight. We are taught there are seven continents, but maybe there are eight. Geologists say Zealandia is number eight. It is in the Pacific Ocean. Six per cent of it is above water and is New Zealand. About 94 per cent is under the ocean. Scientists say it is big enough to be a continent.Geologists said Zealandia does not have to be above water to be a continent. It is a lot higher than the area around it, it has a special geology, its shape is easy to see, and it is thicker than the ocean floor. It would be easy to see Zealandia is a continent if you could pull a plug and let the water out of the world's oceans.", "Engineers have made a thin material from glass and plastic. It can cool buildings and things even under the hot sun. It does not need energy or water to work. It could replace air conditioners, which need lots of power and water. The material is not like anything in nature. It is as thin as the aluminium foil we use for cooking.The engineers explained how the material works. First, it cools anything under it by reflecting the sun. Second, it takes away heat from the thing under it. An engineer is excited about it. He wants to see it in the power industry, aerospace, farming and more. Just a little of the material could cool a house in the summer.", "A Kenyan High Court has stopped the world's largest refugee camp from closing.

Bytedance explained why it bought the app. It wants Musical.ly to help Bytedance across Asia and the world. It wants to create an important \"global platform\" for its content creators and brands to enter new markets. Bytedance also owns a popular news app, called Today's Headlines. This has 120 million active daily users.", "Children should not watch TV, tablet or mobile phone screens before bedtime. Researchers found \"screen time\" before sleeping is bad for children's health. The researchers looked at studies on how bad screen time is for children. They said that 90 per cent of the studies found that screen time delays bedtime. It also leads to less sleep, and poorer sleep quality. Screens are small, so children look at them in bed. Most children have a screen in their bedroom.Children need more sleep than adults. Pre-school children need up to 13 hours, pre-teens up to 12 hours, and teenagers up to ten hours a night. There are three reasons why screens affect children's sleep. First, the light from screens upsets a child's body clock. It makes children think it is daytime. Second, videos excite children and keep their brain active, so they take longer to sleep. Finally, children are not exercising, so they are not tired.", "A study shows many poor people in Hong Kong live in tiny homes. A housing group found that some families live in homes that are smaller than prison cells. The average space was 4.6 square meters per person. This is about half the size of a car parking space. The average size of a prison cell in Hong Kong is 50 per cent bigger than the size of the homes in the study. Over 65 per cent of Hong Kong families live in homes that are between 7 and 14 square meters.Hong Kong has some of the world's most expensive homes. People must save for 18 years to buy a tiny place. People are very unhappy living in such small homes. One person said it was \"unacceptable and inhumane\" that homes are the same size as prison cells in a rich city like Hong Kong. Another person said her house only had a bed, a closet and a small table. She said: \"The bathroom is so small we have to sit sideways to go to the toilet.\"", "An 18-year-old student is suing for $20,000 in damages after her school told her to dye her hair black. The student went to a high school near Osaka, Japan. She had naturally brown hair. Her school told her to dye it black to follow the school's rules. A newspaper reported that school staff told the girl to dye her hair once every four days. She got a rash on her head and her hair became damaged. The girl also suffered from a lot of stress at school.The student told the court that the school bullied her for three years. She was banned from school trips and festivals because of her brown hair. She said that teachers said things to her in class that embarrassed her. This caused her mental stress. She said that a teacher told her that she should not come to school with brown hair. The girl said that her stress made her collapse. She had to go to hospital by ambulance.", "A new project in the UAE will teach one million people computer coding for free. People will learn how to code apps and software. The UAE's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum launched the project. It is called the One Million Arab Coders initiative. It will give young Arabs the skills to develop the digital economy. Sheikh Mohammad said it would create many jobs and let young people work in the global economy online, from their home.The project will encourage young people in the Middle East to get into coding. Around 50 per cent of the Arab population is under 25 years old. Many want to start their own business. Sheikh Mohammad said the project will spread hope, create jobs and let young people, \"successfully lead our region into the future\". He added that: \"Programming is the future.\" The top ten students will get $50,000 each. The top student will win $1 million.", "Pollution is the world's biggest killer. It caused one in six, or 16 per cent, of all global deaths in 2015. Most of these deaths were from diseases like heart disease, lung cancer and stroke. Researchers said 92 per cent of pollution-related deaths were in poor countries, especially countries with a lot of economic development. Bangladesh and Somalia were the countries most affected. Brunei and Sweden had the lowest numbers of deaths because of pollution.A researcher said: \"Pollution, poverty [and] poor health\u2026are deeply [linked].\" He said pollution threatens human rights, such as the right to life and health. Air pollution was the biggest killer. It killed 6.5 million people in 2015. The second biggest killer was water pollution. Next, was pollution in the workplace. A scientist said: \"Air pollution is reaching crisis point.\" People with breathing problems, children and the elderly are hardest hit.", "There is a shortage of potatoes in New Zealand. This means there could be fewer potato chips until next year. Potato chip lovers are calling this a \"chipocalypse\". This is from the words \"chip\" and \"apocalypse\". New Zealand has had a very wet winter. This has hit potato farmers. In some areas, a third of the potatoes used to make potato chips has been lost. This means companies will make fewer potato chips, and prices for potato chips will be higher.The Potatoes New Zealand group told a radio station: \"It started raining in March, and it just simply hasn't stopped. We've had the entire year's worth of rainfall already\u2026.It's continuous, so the soils never get a chance to dry out.\" The group said potatoes are alive and need to breathe, but they are drowning and rotting because they are under water. A big supermarket said: \"We are working\u2026to manage supply as much as possible.\"", "A study said mothers across the world speak to babies in the same way. Researchers from Princeton University said \"motherese\" is a world language. The cute noises and coochy-coos mothers say to babies are very complex. They are a special form of communication. Motherese helps babies develop their language. A researcher said baby talk is more important than we thought. She said: \"It is not something to be embarrassed about at all.\"The researchers recorded 24 different mothers. They spoke 10 different languages. Their babies were between seven months and one year. The researchers said they recorded mothers playing with and reading to their babies, just like they do at home. Mothers change the quality of their voices when they speak to their babies, in any language. The study didn't look at fathers' talk, but fathers probably speak to their babies in a similar way across the world.", "Everyone knows that children don't like eating greens. Parents can't get their children to eat vegetables. A new study explains why. The study looked at the eating habits of young children. The study found that genes can make children dislike greens. The children can become fussy eaters. This means parents do not have to stress if their children do not eat vegetables. Many parents worry about what their children eat.DNA changes how small children taste things. They think many vegetables taste bitter. A researcher into obesity said it was not surprising that children have a sensitive taste. Many children think broccoli is bitter. The new research could help to fight obesity in children. The researcher said there needs to be more research. She said: \"There is a huge gap in the research when children [move] from a milk-based diet to foods that the rest of the family eats.\"", "The Nobel Prize in chemistry went to three scientists. They will share the $1,090,000 prize. They found a special way of photographing molecules. Molecules are the smallest building blocks in our body and in everything around us. The scientists made a technique called cryo-EM. It can zoom in to amazing new levels. Scientists can now see things in our bodies never seen before. They can see how molecules move.The Nobel committee said cryo-EM will change science forever and move science into a new era. It added: \"Soon, there will be no more secrets. Now we can see the\u2026details of [molecules] in every corner of our cells and every drop of our body fluids. We can understand how\u2026they act and how they work together\u2026.We are facing a revolution.\" A professor said there were many uses for cryo-EM. Scientists can look at viruses and find cures for many diseases.", "Austria has banned full-face veils. Muslim women cannot wear a full-face veil in public. Their face must be showing from the hair to the chin. Austria said the law is to protect its values. Muslim groups said the law is unfair. It is against human rights and religious freedom. A small minority of Austrians wears full-face veils. Officials say the law might damage Austria's economy. Many Muslim tourists might decide not to visit Austria. Other European countries banned the veil. France and Belgium had bans in 2011. Holland is working on passing a ban. Germany's leader said the full-face veil should be banned, \"wherever it is legally possible\". The Islamic community in Austria said the new law was unfair. It said veiled women in Austria are now \"criminals\". They have to stay in their home. A supporter of the ban said: \"It's not right that those living here don't show their faces.\"", "Many plants are in danger of dying out. A scientist said one in five of the world's plants is in danger. Botanic gardens contain about 100,000 species, including many endangered plants. They help to protect endangered and rare plants. The scientist said: \"We have [looked] at the wide range of plants grown, managed and conserved in botanic gardens\u2026.We know what we have and, perhaps more importantly, what is missing from botanic gardens.\"A researcher said botanic gardens were the best hope for saving endangered plants. He said there was no reason why one-fifth of plants is under threat. If we do not protect plants, we could have trouble finding food in the future. We will also have problems solving problems like climate change. Many plants are in danger because humans cut down forests for farms and cities. Plants are also in danger from climate change.", "Police said a man who bombed a London subway train bought the parts online. Police think an 18-year-old refugee left the bomb on a packed commuter train during the rush hour. It exploded at Parsons Green station at 8.20am. About 30 passengers had burns to their face and body. Police said the bomb didn't work properly and that more people could have been hurt. The bomb had knives, screws, glass and other dangerous things inside it.The bomber bought many of the ingredients from Amazon. One ingredient was an explosive called TATP. It is called \"Mother of Satan\" because of its power. Police said the bomber wanted \"maximum destruction\". Reporters were shocked that Amazon's site directed visitors to other things that could make bombs. Amazon said it would stop this happening. It is reviewing its website to make sure its products are presented in a better way.", "Today's teenagers are growing up more slowly. Researchers looked at the behaviour of 8 million teens in seven countries over the past 40 years. Today's teens are not as responsible as teenagers from the 70s, 80s and 90s. A professor said their development has slowed down. She said today's 18-year-olds are like 15-year-olds used to be. She said teenagers are taking fewer risks than they did before.Today's teenagers take longer to do things their parents did. They are older when they date, work and drive. The professor said they have a, \"slow life strategy\". More teenagers live with their parents instead of renting their own room. One reason for this is teenagers spend a long time online. They use social media, look at videos or play games instead of living in the \"real world\". Another reason is parents do too much for their children.", "New research says bald men should not worry about their looks. Men get stressed about losing their hair. The research shows that women and men think bald men are more attractive, more confident and taller. People had to rate photos of men for attractiveness, confidence and dominance. Bald men came top in every category. The study said: \"[Bald] men were viewed as nearly [2 centimetres] taller and 13 per cent stronger.\"The researchers said bald men could do better in life. They could be more successful in business because they look stronger. There is some bad news for bald men. A bald head makes a man look about four years older. About 85 per cent of men will be going bald by the age of 50. Men spend billions of dollars every year trying to stop hair loss. They should be happy to be bald. Researchers said men should finish, \"what Mother Nature has started\".", "The UN has said the Rohingya in Myanmar are facing a catastrophe. Over 379,000 Rohingya have escaped over the border to Bangladesh. The UN said the Rohingya are being attacked by Myanmar's security forces. The BBC said many villages have been burned down. Myanmar's army said it isn't attacking the Rohingya. The Rohingya are mostly Muslim. They have lived in Myanmar for hundreds of years, but Myanmar says they are illegal immigrants.Many people asked Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi to help the Rohingya. They want her Nobel Peace Prize to be taken away and that she cannot keep it while the Rohingya are suffering. Ms Suu Kyi has not criticized the attacks on the Rohingya. Bangladesh asked Myanmar to take the Rohingya refugees back. The Myanmar army said no. It said Buddhists are the original people of Rakhine state, where most Rohingyas live.", "Archaeologists have found three 3,500-year-old mummies in Egypt. The mummies are a woman and her two sons. The woman may be the wife of a royal goldsmith called Amenemhat. There was a statue of the goldsmith with the woman in the tomb. The tomb is near Luxor on the River Nile. Luxor is 700km south of Cairo, the capital city of Egypt. The woman was about 50 when she died. She died from a bone disease.The site that contains the tomb had a courtyard and two burial shafts. A team of Egyptian archaeologists spent six years digging in the site. One archaeologist told Arab News that Luxor has one-third of the world's ancient monuments. He said many visitors will enjoy looking at the new mummies. They will help Egypt's tourism industry. A top Egyptian archaeologist, Dr Khaled al-Anani, hopes there are more mummies in the area.", "Vladimir Putin warned that the North Korean crisis could cause a \"planetary catastrophe\". He said war would cause a huge loss of life. He told reporters that talking was the only answer. He warned the USA and North Korea that military action was very dangerous. Mr Putin said North Korea would never stop its nuclear programme. He said: \"They will eat grass instead of stopping their nuclear programme, as long as they do not feel safe.\"Tensions in Korea are at dangerous levels because North Korea carried out its biggest ever nuclear test. The UN told North Korea to stop its testing. Many countries want strong sanctions against North Korea. Mr Putin said sanctions would never work and they would be useless. A US ambassador said North Korea was \"begging for war\". She said: \"War is never something the US wants. We don't want it now. But our\u2026patience is not unlimited. We will defend our allies.\"", "Why do we yawn? Do you yawn when others yawn? A new study has researched this. It found that yawning is contagious and unstoppable. We automatically yawn when we see others yawn. We yawn more when we try to stop yawning. Some people want to yawn a lot more than other people. Researcher Professor Stephen Jackson said that even reading about yawning could make us yawn. You might even want to yawn right now.The researchers studied the actions and brain activity of 36 people. The people looked at videos of people yawning. They then had to yawn or stop themselves yawning. The people were videoed doing this. The researchers checked the brain activity of the adults. Jackson said understanding more about yawning will help to treat illnesses like dementia and epilepsy. He said he was looking for possible non-drug treatments that might help the brain.", "A Nigerian scientist has made a new computer that has artificial intelligence. Dr Oshi Agabi's new computer can smell. He called it Koniku. He has raised over $1 million and his project has made $10 million in profit. Google and Microsoft, and security companies are interested in it. Koniku will be in drones and airport security systems. It will smell bombs and explosives. It will also be in hospitals to smell diseases in humans.Dr Agabi did not use silicon chips in Koniku. These are not powerful enough to make things to recognize smells. Agabi based his device on neurons from mice. Neurons are brain cells that share information. They use electricity to send information. Using neurons in computers is called biotechnology. Agabi said: \"Biology is technology\u2026.Our deep learning networks are all copying the brain.\" He added: \"We want to build a\u2026system that has intelligence.\"", "Google will soon let people check their mental health online. People searching for \"depression\" will get a link to a questionnaire with nine questions. This will check to see if you could have depression. Google has partnered with America's National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) on the project. NAMI said the questionnaire can help people decide if they need a doctor. At first, the questionnaire is only for people in the USA.The questionnaire could help people get treatment more quickly. Google said: \"Statistics show that those who have symptoms of depression experience\u2026a six- to eight-year delay in getting treatment\u2026.We believe that awareness of depression can [enable] quicker access to treatment.\" However, a doctor said Google's questionnaire was the same as online information.

There has been a 45 per cent rise in anti-Semitism since 2014. Anti-Semitism is discrimination against Jews. Research from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism (CAA) shows that only 59 per cent of British Jews feel welcome there. More than 10,000 British Jews were interviewed. Around 40 per cent of them were afraid and hid their religion in public.Most British Jews believed that a political party's negative opinions on Israel has increased bad feeling towards Jews. They said its leader does not control anti-Semitism. In addition, fewer than 24 anti-Semitic crimes go to court each year. The CAA warned: \"Without urgent change, British Jews may start to leave.\" The UK government said: \"There can never be an excuse for hatred towards the Jewish community. We shall oppose and challenge it.\"", "A Chinese man bought 5,000 people a bowl of noodles. The man's name is Mr Wang. He lost a $45,000 engagement ring.

Benjamin David beats the traffic by swimming 2km down a river in Germany. He drags his laptop, phone and his suit in a waterproof bag behind him. David realized the river outside his apartment went past his office. He decided to swim to work and get some exercise. This was better than battling commuters on buses or breathing fumes while cycling.David's river commute has made him fitter and less stressed. He said: \"When I was on my bike, I would yell at cars. When I was on foot, I would yell at cyclists, and so on.\" He added: \"Just a few metres to the side of [all the traffic] is the river, and if you just swim down that, it's completely relaxing.\" David said river swimming can be dangerous. He always checks the water temperature. In some cities it is illegal to swim in rivers.", "President Donald Trump warned North Korea over its missiles.

It says no one can cross a street or road while looking at mobile phones, tablets and digital cameras. There is a $15-$35 fine. People who break the law for a second time will get a $99 fine. Honolulu's mayor said the law was because there were many injuries and deaths when pedestrians use mobile devices.People who text while walking are called \"phone zombies\". The ban is so people know more about the dangers of texting while walking. The mayor said there were too many accidents in Honolulu. He added that if people had more common sense, he would not have to pass this law. Another lawmaker said we have a lot of technology today but we forget about staying safe. The new law is like one that bans texting while driving.", "Police in London have 1,000 special kits to deal with acid attacks. The number of attacks is increasing. Two weeks ago, there were five different attacks on one night. The criminals wanted to steal the people's motorbikes. The number of crimes involving acid has doubled in London in three years. A plastic surgeon said the number of patients he treats for acid attacks has reached \"epidemic\" levels. He said there had been an \"explosion\" of attacks.The acid attack kits have protective clothing and five-litre bottles of water. The rise in attacks could be because knives and guns are more difficult to get. Gangs are using acid instead because it is easy to buy and hide. A police spokesman spoke about the acid attacks. He said: \"These are life-changing injuries.\" He added that the police are working hard to fight this crime. They are looking for a safer way to find acid on the streets.", "A five-year-old in London was fined for selling lemonade. The fine upset her. She thought she did something wrong.

Parents do their best to keep dirt away from babies. A scientist says dirt is important because it makes babies stronger. Dr Jack Gilbert did research into how dirt affects children. His research is in a book called 'Dirt is Good: The Advantage of Germs for Your Child\u2019s Developing Immune System'. He said: \"It's fine to wash their hands\u2026.but if a dog licks their face, that's not a bad thing.\"Dr Gilbert said letting children get dirty was good. The dirt helps babies to build their immune system. Children often get allergies because parents clean everything that children use. This makes children's immune systems weaker, which can cause asthma and food allergies. Gilbert said the \"five-second rule\" is OK. This is when you eat something that fell on the floor for fewer than five seconds. Gilbert says it is OK if the floor isn't really dirty. ", "House dust could make us fat. Scientists say people should keep their house clean to not get fat. The scientists did research on mice. They collected dust from 11 houses. Dust from nine of the houses made the mice fatter. The dust changed the hormones in the mice and made more fat in their bodies. We breathe in and swallow small amounts of dust. A researcher said small amounts of dust made the mice fatter.Dust contains chemicals called EDCs. They are in sofas and carpets. They are also in cosmetics, food packaging, and household cleaners. EDCs are in most houses. Researchers say they can affect our health. Children are at most risk. EDCs can lead to learning problems. EDCs can increase the risk of cancer and infertility. The researchers say we need to look at all the things we make so that they do not make us unhealthy.", "Scientists have found a \"toxic cocktail\" of chemicals on Mars. It would kill any living thing. The scientists say the discovery of the chemicals means the chance of finding life on Mars is very low. The scientists study the places in the universe that might have life. Mars has no ozone layer. This means there are high levels of ultra-violet (UV) radiation. This mixes with the chemicals and makes it impossible for anything to grow on Mars. The scientists said that just the chemicals were enough to kill living things. When they mix with UV rays, the mix kills living things 11 times faster. The scientists said: \"The surface of\u2026Mars is highly [harmful] to cells, caused by a toxic cocktail of [chemicals] and UV radiation.\" They say their research is evidence that the land on Mars is deadly to any kind of plant life.

People once believed rounder eggs contained male chicks, but that was wrong. A new study says that the shape makes the bird fly better. A professor said birds have changed to lay eggs that have different shapes. They are all different in shape - everything from a round owl's egg to a pointy sandpiper egg.The scientists put information about 50,000 eggs from 1,400 different bird species into a computer. They looked at the shape, length and height of the eggs. They also looked at how oval the eggs were. Birds with the most-oval-shaped eggs were the best fliers. The team was shocked to find that egg shape affected how well birds fly. Hummingbirds have the most-oval-shaped eggs; owls have the roundest eggs; and sea birds have the pointiest eggs.", "YouTube has a plan \"to fight online terror\". It will find dangerous videos and delete them. This includes videos on how to make fire-bombs. Google owns YouTube. Google announced four things YouTube would do about this problem. One thing will be to find and delete videos that might help terrorists. YouTube will also find videos that could get people to become terrorists. Finally, YouTube will show \"anti-terrorism\" adverts.There are many problems with these four things. It is a big job to look at so many videos. Over one hour of video is uploaded on YouTube every second. That's one hundred years' of video every 10 days. Another problem is that many of the videos are not illegal. Terrorists could use a BBC news video in the wrong way. Google will use software to find bad videos. A final problem is deleting videos that do not break YouTube's guidelines, but help terrorists.", "Scientists have made a drug that copies how sunlight affects our skin. It tricks our skin into becoming darker. It gets our body to make melanin. Melanin is what gives our skin its colour. The scientists are from a hospital in the USA.

People can pay traffic fines and use other police services using RoboCop. It is also linked to a police station, so people can talk to real police officers. The 170-centimetre-tall RoboCop can speak six languages. It can also shake hands, and work out people's feelings.By 2030, 25 per cent of the Dubai Police force will be robots. Dubai will also have the world's first smart police station. No humans will work there. RoboCop will help the Dubai Police to fight crime, keep the city safe and improve happiness levels. It will also help people in malls, airports and on the streets. Someone at the security conference said that: \"The age of the robots is no longer coming. It has arrived.\"", "Scientists think they know how flamingos stand on one leg. We all love these beautiful birds doing this. Scientists have always wondered how they do this. Researchers say they have found the answer to this secret. A professor says the flamingo's skeleton helps it stand on one leg. Its hips and leg bones give the bird great balance. Flamingos do not have to use their muscles a lot to keep standing on one leg.Another researcher said the flamingo is unique because it can stand on one leg. This is very difficult for humans, even for one hour. Most of us don't know that we're moving all the time. Even when we stand still, our muscles work so we don't fall over. Flamingos do not need to use many muscles to keep still. They can save energy by standing on one leg. Saving energy could be why other birds also stand on one leg.", "Germany has the first female referee in Europe's top leagues. Germany's Bundesliga promoted Bibiana Steinhaus on Friday.

Now that dream has come true.", "Microsoft is angry with America's National Security Agency (NSA). It said the WannaCry ransomware cyber-attack was because the NSA stores cyber-weapons. Ransomware is software that blocks computers until the owner pays money to hackers. The NSA helps keep America's communications and information systems safe. It also stops cyber-attacks. However, experts say the WannaCry hackers used spying tools from the NSA. Microsoft said governments must wake up to the problem of cyber-weapons. Stealing them is as dangerous as stealing missiles. Microsoft said the WannaCry attack shows why keeping cyber-weapons is a problem. Europe's police said WannaCry harmed 200,000 computers in 150 countries. It made many problems for Britain's hospitals. Many operations were cancelled. Experts told people to back up their files because more attacks could come.", "The Maori war dance (the haka) and being bilingual may help to keep dementia away. Researchers in New Zealand say doing the haka and speaking two languages might help Maoris avoid dementia. A study compared dementia among people in their 80s and 90s. Maoris have less health care, less income and more heart diseases than non-Maoris. However, researchers found no differences between Maoris and non-Maoris.The haka is an old war cry. People chant and do an energetic dance. They stamp their feet. Warriors did it before battles to show their strength to their enemy. The famous All Blacks rugby team started using it before their matches in 1905. The All Blacks now do it before all the games they play. A Maori professor said that the thinking about the difficult dance routines of the haka helps to keep the brain healthy.", "The singer Nicki Minaj will pay the tuition fees for 30 of her Twitter followers if they get A-grades.

The chemical made the body burn fat instead of sugar. This improves your stamina to the same level as someone who exercises.", "Britain said a third of the world's food is wasted. It said this was \"unacceptable\". The UK wastes over 7 million tons of food every year. A politician talked about solutions to this problem. First, schools could raise children's awareness of food waste. Secondly, supermarkets could sell vegetables they throw away because they are the \"wrong\" shape. Finally, \"sell-by\" dates need to change. People throw away good food because of these labels.The politician said food waste was unacceptable. He said: \"Socially, it is a scandal that people are going hungry\u2026when so much [food] is being wasted.\" He added that: \"Environmentally, it is a disaster, because energy and resources are wasted.\" He said the food rots and produces a climate-changing gas.

The government has a new project to help people who want to work more. People who work more hours will get vouchers to get help with the housework, such as cleaning and ironing. This will help to support family life and to reduce the shadow economy. The shadow economy is when people pay for things in cash but do not pay tax, so the government loses money.The government said that women work less than they want to because they do housework and look after the family. If these women worked longer hours, they would get a government voucher and could then afford to pay for help with the housework. The new system would create jobs for people and create more tax for the government.

A study on shampoo said: \"People are working from home\u2026and fewer people are smoking, so [they] are using less shampoo.\" A hair website said shampooing often may be why hair gets greasy. It makes the scalp dry, so the head produces more oil, which you have to shampoo again. Not shampooing mean less oil.Many people say shampoo is good. A top hairdresser said there is no benefit to not using shampoo. He said it is gentle on your head and makes the hair look shiny and glossy. He added that the hair's oil doesn't clean it.

It says these children have fewer behavioural, social and emotional problems. Researchers looked at data from 4,741 mothers. A researcher said we are more flexible and more tolerant of others as we get older. He said this could be why older mothers do not scold and hit their children so much. He said this kind of parenting can lead to a positive environment as the children grow up.The research said the average age of the mothers was 31. Older mothers worry less during pregnancy and are usually more positive about having children. This may mean they are more caring. They also have stronger relationships, more money and a better education. Researchers found that children with older mothers have better language skills. This may be because older mothers spend more time with their children and talk to them more.", "Scientists in the UK have found a way to mass produce blood. The blood is good enough to give to hospital patients. The old way of making blood in a laboratory was very slow. It was difficult to make a lot of blood and it was very expensive. The new way means scientists can make an \"unlimited\" amount\" of blood. A researcher said: \"We have [shown] a [workable] way to sustainably manufacture red cells.\"Another researcher told reporters his team now needs the technology to mass produce blood. He said that would be a challenge. He said that at first, his team would produce only rare types of blood. He said these are difficult to find with usual blood donations.

Researchers have a possible answer to this. A recent study says the Earth's climate could change the shape of our nose. The study found that people with wider noses live in warm, humid areas. People with narrower noses live in colder, drier places. The nose makes sure that the air we breathe is warm and moist when it gets to our lungs. The nose is a little like a temperature controller.Researchers used images to measure the nose width and height, and the distance between the two nostrils of over 2,600 Africans, Asians and Europeans. The study could help people with the heat or cold, and the humidity if they go to other countries. It could also help with breathing problems. A researcher said it is difficult to predict the future shape of the nose. This is because we travel a lot, our lifestyles have changed, and because of climate change.", "The creator of the World Wide Web has warned of big Internet dangers. He said people are misusing the web. The first danger is companies are creating fake news to make money or change politics. He said fake news \"spreads like wildfire\". The second danger is political advertising used in \"unethical ways\". It can stop voters from voting. His final worry is the misuse of personal data. Governments kill people because of the websites they use.Tim Berners-Lee invented the web in 1989. His vision was for a platform that would let everyone, everywhere share information, access opportunities and work together across borders and cultures.

A study says anyone can upgrade their memory if they train their brain. We can train our brain to be a \"memory athlete,\" like athletes train their body. Scientist Martin Dresler said six weeks of training can help people remember many things. Dr Dresler said people could train their brain to enter the World Memory Championships.Dr Dresler looked at MRI scans of the brains of 23 memory champions and the brains of \"normal\" people. He was surprised to find no differences. This made him think we can all become memory athletes. Dresler studied people who did 40 days of training using a memory technique called mnemonics. They more than doubled their memory. Mnemonics is an old method that helps people remember things, especially in lists.

TRAPPIST-1 is a small sun with seven Earth-sized planets, like our own solar system. A NASA scientist said three of the planets get as much heat as the Earth. He said this provides an environment for life to exist. TRAPPIST-1 is nearly 40 light-years away from Earth. Its sun is smaller and less bright than our Sun, but it could support life.The NASA scientist said you would have a wonderful view of the other planets if you were on any of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. They would not be like dots of light. They would look bigger than our Moon. You would see things on them. Another scientist said life can live in caves that are 130-degrees centigrade and at the bottom of the ocean where there is no light. She said it is possible that life is on some of the TRAPPIST-1 planets.", "Modern music is on Bulgarian radio again. For two months, there has been only classical music or folk songs that were over 70 years old, before World War II. Copyright rules meant the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) could not play pop music. In the European Union, copyright disappears 70 years after an artist's death. BNR made a deal with the copyright organization. It will now pay more royalties \u2013 money given to artists every time it plays their songs. In the past two months, the number of listeners to BNR's shows went up by 20 per cent. It seems listeners like listening to older music like Bulgarian folk tunes, classical music and pre-war jazz more than Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. BNR might change the music it plays. The boss of BNR, Aleksandar Velev, said there could be new radio stations. He said current radio shows will not change, but there will be new shows with different types of music.", "Scientists in the USA and Italy did tests on mice that show fasting can be healthy. Fasting is eating or drinking little or nothing for a short period of time. Scientists found that fasting can lower the risk of diabetes, heart disease, cancer and other diseases. The scientists gave the mice a low-calorie, high-fat diet for four days. They then gave the mice just 10% of their normal food for three days. This made the pancreas in the mice work better.The pancreas is the organ that makes the hormone insulin. Insulin breaks down sugar in the blood. People with diabetes have too much sugar in their blood. They have health problems and can die. People with type 1 diabetes do not produce any insulin. People with type 2 diabetes do not produce enough, or it has no effect. Scientists said fasting increased the amounts of insulin.

This is a largely underwater landmass in the Pacific. Six per cent of it is above water and is New Zealand. The rest is under the ocean. Scientists say it is big enough to be a continent.Geologists explained why Zealandia is a continent in a research paper. They said the land does not have to be above water to be a continent. Zealandia is a continent because it is a lot higher than the area around it, it has a special geology, it is easy to see its shape, and it is thicker than the ocean floor. It would be easy to understand that Zealandia is a continent, \"if you could pull the plug on the world's oceans\" and let the water out.", "Engineers in the USA have made a super-thin material that can cool buildings. The amazing new material can cool things even under the hot sun. The material does not need energy or water to work. It could do the work of air conditioners, which need a lot of energy and water.

It is a mix of glass and plastic and is just 50 micrometers thick \u2013 about the same as the aluminium foil we use for cooking.The engineers explained how the material works. When it is put on top of something, two things happen. First, it cools the thing under it by reflecting the sun's rays. Second, the material takes away heat from the thing underneath. An engineer said he was excited about the chance to use it \"in the power industry, aerospace, agriculture and more\". Just 10 square meters of the material could cool down a house in the summer.", "A Kenyan High Court has stopped the government from closing the world's largest refugee camp. Kenya's government wanted to close the Dadaab camp and send 260,000 refugees back to Somalia. The court decided this was wrong.

Mr Abe also said: \"We must never repeat the horrors of war again. This is the serious vow the people of Japan have taken.\" President Obama welcomed Mr Abe, \"in the spirit of friendship\".A total of 353 Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor, killing 2,403 people. The attack also damaged or destroyed 19 US warships. Mr Abe is the first Japanese leader to visit a special memorial there. He spoke about the US helping Japan after WWII. He said after the war, \"Japan was a nation in burnt-out ruins as far as the eye could see, suffering miserable poverty\" and the USA sent food and clothes. He said the two countries had an \"alliance of hope\".", "A study shows that female doctors are better than male doctors, but get less pay. Researchers looked at three million medical records. The percentages of readmissions (people who had to stay in hospital a second time) and mortality (deaths) were lower if the doctor was female. Mortality rates were 15.02 per cent and readmission rates were 11.07 per cent for female doctors. They were 15.57 per cent and 11.49 per cent for male doctors.Researchers did not say why women gave better care. Dr. Ashish Jha said \"approximately 32,000 fewer patients would die\" in the USA each year if male doctors did as well as female doctors. He also said it was wrong that male doctors got paid more than female doctors, because women were better at their jobs. Dr Jha said: \"We need to understand why these differences exist,\" so female and male doctors work equally well and get the same pay.", "Scientists now know the secrets to one of the world's least understood fish \u2013 the seahorse. Researchers worked out the genetic map of the tiger tail seahorse. Scientists can now find out why seahorses are so different to other fish. They have no teeth. Male seahorses carry babies and give birth to them instead of females. Also, seahorses do not swim forwards and sideways like other fish; they swim vertically (up and down).Seahorses started to get their unusual shape about 100 million years ago. They began to look like the neck and head of a horse. There are 54 different seahorses. The scientific name for a seahorse is Hippocampus. This word comes from the Ancient Greek words hippos ('horse') and kampos ('sea monster'). The word 'seahorse' can be written as two separate words (sea horse), or with a dash (sea-horse).", "Venezuela's government took 4 million children's toys from a toy company.

Researchers in the USA looked at the behaviour of 45 female monkeys. The monkeys with a lower social status were unhealthier. The monkeys were split into groups. They had time to get to know each other. Researchers then took one monkey from each group and put her into another group. Researchers found that the \"new girl\" was unhealthier than the other monkeys.The researchers said that although their study was on monkeys, it could also be true for humans because we share a lot of our DNA with monkeys. A professor told the BBC News that governments should understand that people with a lower social status have more health problems. He said they have got cars and TVs, but that does not mean they are happy.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said its $1 billion GOES-R satellite will take weather photos five times faster than other satellites, with four times higher image quality. The NOAA said: \"Without a doubt, GOES-R will [change] weather forecasting.\" It will be like the difference between black and white TV and HD TV.The new satellite will give real-time images. These will make us safer. Airline pilots will be able to stay away from turbulence. GOES-R will zoom in on weather events to get more detailed pictures. This will help to warn people and save lives and property. People will have better information about hurricanes, flooding, ash clouds, and more. The NOAA said: \"It will give the weather as it's looking now rather than [what] happened 15 to 30 minutes ago.\"", "Biologists have a new way to increase the size of crops by 20 per cent. They changed the thing in plants that is used in photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the when plants use sunlight to change carbon dioxide into oxygen. This lets us breathe. The scientists found a way for plants to use the energy they get from sunlight better. Professor Stephen Long said his team is changing the genes in crops such as rice, wheat, maize and soybean.The scientists changed the thing plants use to protect themselves from the Sun. Plants turn energy into heat when they get too hot. However, they do this even when it is cloudy. The scientists put copies of the heat-loss gene into plants. These help plants to quickly return to using energy to grow. Professor Long said if crops can produce 20 per cent more food, it will help the food supply in the future.", "Israel has OK'd a bill to make mosques quieter. The bill says loudspeakers at mosques during the call to prayer are too loud and damage people's quality of life. The call to prayer happens five times a day.

The sweet potatoes have extra amounts of Vitamin A. This means they have more nutrition. One researcher said farmers didn't want to help him at first. The researcher said: \"They told me it was a bad idea.\" The farmers said their job was to grow more potatoes, kill pests and reduce poverty. They said it wasn't to increase nutrition.The sweet potato could stop people dying from malnutrition - not having enough to eat. A lack of Vitamin A is very harmful. Scientists say malnutrition harms 140 million children in 118 countries. It affects seven million pregnant women and is a big reason for children becoming blind. The International Potato Center said the prize-winning sweet potatoes could help people get enough Vitamin A. It hopes there will be more vegetables with extra nutrition.", "NASA scientists want to get humans to Mars. Researchers are trying to find out what plants can grow on Mars. They hope astronauts will grow their own food on the Red Planet. Getting to Mars could take two-and-a-half years. The astronauts will need a lot of food for the journey. They can never come back to Earth. This means they will need to grow their own food from seeds. This could be a problem because Mars doesn't have good soil. It just has red dust.Humans could be on Mars in the next 15 years. NASA has been testing \"Martian gardens\" using a soil made of volcanic dust. It has no nutrients or organic material, so it is similar to Mars dust. The scientists grew lettuce in it and it tasted normal. The lettuce had weaker roots and took longer to grow. NASA said testing 'Martian gardens' on Earth would help to develop ways of growing food on Mars in the future.", "A new report says the world needs another 69 million teachers by 2030.

Around 25 million of these might never go.The UN says there are not enough teachers in countries with growing populations. More children means it is harder to find enough teachers. The UN says \"urgent action\" is needed or things will get worse. The UN is also worried about the quality of teachers. In some countries only 60 per cent of teachers are trained. There are also worries about class sizes. In some countries, there are over 100 children in one class. This has been a problem for many years.", "India and Pakistan have bad relations. They have argued for many years over borders in Kashmir. The latest disagreement is about movies and actors. Pakistan's biggest cinemas have banned Indian movies in Pakistan's big cities. Cinema owners say the ban is to support Pakistani soldiers risking their lives in Kashmir. The ban is because Indian moviemakers stopped Pakistani actors from working in Bollywood movie studios in Mumbai.Bollywood movies are very popular in Pakistan. Cinemas will lose a lot of money. People will stay at home. Pakistani actors will also lose money. They will get less money from making movies in Pakistan than in Bollywood. Pakistani actors said it was time to stop working in Bollywood. Actor Hamza Ali Abbasi said: \"Pakistani artists must boycott Bollywood.\" Movie star Agha Ali agreed. He said: \"I think it should have been done a long time ago.\"", "Allergies to eggs and peanuts can be deadly. However, researchers say that giving eggs and peanuts to babies may stop them getting allergies. The researchers looked at when over 200,000 babies first ate eggs and peanuts. They found that if 4-6-month-old babies ate eggs, they were 40 per cent less likely to get an egg allergy. Babies aged four-to-11 months old who ate peanut products were 70 per cent less likely to get a peanut allergy.Egg and peanut allergies are the two most common childhood food allergies. Parents must be careful because babies can choke on whole nuts. They should also only eat smooth peanut butter. Other food allergies are to soy, wheat and seafood. Giving these foods to babies one at a time may protect them. Parents should check their baby's health after each new food. More research is needed to find the best ages to start giving eggs and peanuts to babies.", "People who use the Internet too much may have mental health problems. They may have problems if they cannot get online regularly. A survey from a Canadian university looked at the Internet habits of 254 students and their mental health.

Scientists think dolphins also use words and sentences to speak to each other. New research shows this communication is similar to our conversations. The sounds that dolphins make look like sentences that let dolphins send messages to each other, identify themselves, have relations, and do things together. We may be able to understand dolphin language and talk to dolphins in the future.Researchers discovered that dolphins had their own language after they recorded two bottlenose dolphins. The dolphins listened to each other and then replied.

Scientists studied the material and his weapons and accessories to get an idea of how early humans lived. They even have an idea of how Otzi sounded. Otzi gave \"valuable information\" about how humans used animals.Otzi's clothes were from different animals. His leggings were goat leather; his hat was bear fur; and his leather coat was from four different kinds of animals. His shoes were made from grass. Otzi had 61 tattoos. These were to make pain go away, not for beauty. He had problems with his heart and with his teeth. Otzi was 45 when he died. This was old for a man 5,000 years ago. Someone killed him with an arrow, which hit him in the head. ", "Humans learn a lot from nature that helps us every day. The latest thing is self-repairing clothing. Scientists have made cotton, linen and wool clothes that can repair themselves, without the need for sewing. Scientists in the USA looked at how squid stick to things so well. They found a sticky protein on the suckers of squid. The protein is like the one found in the silk that spiders use to make spider webs. It is very strong and stretchy.The new protein will be put on clothes. A rip or tear will join together in less than a minute after it is dipped in water. Soldiers and other people will be safer with clothes that repair quickly and easily.

Doctors keep telling us that sitting down a lot makes our life shorter. Sitting in a chair all day is as dangerous as smoking or being overweight. Sitting for eight hours increases the risk of dying early by 60 per cent. However, there is good news. One hour's exercise each day can cancel the risk of dying early from sitting all day.The research was published in time for the Olympic Games. Researchers hope this will get people to exercise more. Watching TV all day is very unhealthy because we will also eat unhealthy snacks. No exercise increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes and cancer. People should get out of their seat more.

Outdoor learning is important for social skills, health and development. It also gives a better quality of life. Researchers say that schools did not take the advice of important reports about outdoor learning. This means there is less outdoor learning today. The researchers want all schools to do more outdoor learning.There are many benefits of outdoor learning for children. One advantage is that it builds confidence in children. They experience things like climbing trees. It also teaches children about the environment and to respect nature. There are also health benefits. Children exercise instead of sitting in classrooms or being at home with video games. It also helps with the problem of 'stranger danger'.

It will also save electricity and lower the costs of being in the building. One reason for doing this is the Japanese yen is becoming stronger, especially since the UK voted to leave the EU. In January, one dollar was nearly 120 yen; now it is just above 100 yen. A stronger yen means Toyota cars are more expensive and profits go down. Toyota's profit last year was a record $23 billion.Toyota said it decided to shut down the elevators weeks ago. It is also changing the temperature of air conditioners to save money. Toyota did similar things after the financial crisis of 2008. That also made the yen stronger against the dollar.

A study from an American university says it is rare for men to do an equal share of housework. Researchers looked at 182 working couples. Both partners worked the same number of hours in full-time jobs. Men did five hours a week less housework after their baby was born, even though both parents worked the same number of hours in their job. They spent this time helping with the baby.Becoming a parent added about 21 hours per week to a mother's work. Most of this was looking after her baby. New fathers did not do extra work because they did not realise the mother was doing so much more. Another reason is that after a baby is born, fathers follow the 'traditional' roles in society, where the mother looks after the baby and the father works. This happens even when the mother is working the same number of hours in her job.", "Britain's Duke and Duchess of Cambridge named their new baby daughter Charlotte. She was born on Saturday.

When children are being taken from their mothers and put in cages, you are acting with...generosity and common sense.\" He called world leaders \"half-men\" and \"cowards\" who have no solutions.Sting said Greece helped nearly a million refugees in 2015, even though it had a financial crisis. Other countries refused to help the refugees. Many built barbed-wire fences to keep them out. Sting attacked the recent family-separation policy in the USA. More than 2,000 children have been separated from parents who tried to cross the Mexico border into the US illegally. The concert audience cheered when Sting called this policy \"brutal\". Some European countries still won't help refugees. Italy recently turned away a boat of 350 immigrants. Spain eventually took them in.", "Algeria has turned off its Internet to stop students cheating in school exams. The government wants to stop students secretly going online during nationwide tests. The Internet stops for an hour after the start of each exam. The government will shut the Internet down during the exam season, from June 20 to June 25. In addition, all devices with Internet access have been banned from 2,000 exam centers. Even teachers cannot have their phones. There were many problems in 2016. Test questions were leaked online before and during exams.Algeria's Education Minister told a newspaper that Facebook would also be blocked for the six days of the exams. She does not like doing this but needs to do something to stop students cheating. For more security, metal detectors will be put in all exam halls. Also, security cameras and mobile-phone blockers are now at the companies where the exams are printed. Many students think the government is doing the right thing. Rania Salim, 16, said it was unfair that students who didn't study could get help in exams by using their mobile phone to cheat.", "A UK politician has blocked a law on upskirting from being passed. Upskirting is when someone secretly takes a photo under someone else's skirt. Politicians wanted to make it a crime, with a two-year prison sentence. However, Sir Christopher Chope blocked the attempt to pass the law. He is a member of the ruling Conservative Party. Prime Minister Theresa May said she was \"disappointed\" that a member of her party blocked it. She wants to see upskirting become a criminal offence. She wants to see the bill pass soon, \"with government support\".Upskirting is a big problem around the world because of mobile phones. Thousands of women have complained that men took photos up their skirts. The man often uploads the photo to a website. Mr Chope did not tell reporters why he blocked the bill. However, the woman who started the campaign for the upskirting law said Chope told her that he objected to it because it \"wasn't debated\" in parliament. She also said he \"wasn't really sure\" what upskirting was. A politician said it was \"absolutely disgusting that a male politician blocked upskirting from becoming a crime.", "Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un could get a Nobel Peace Prize. The two leaders could win the award after their historic meeting in Singapore. Betting companies cut their odds on one or both of them getting the prize. President Trump is now 2/1 to get it, either alone or as part of a team. North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons and the USA stopping \"war games\" with South Korea would definitely make the world a safer place. A Nobel Prize historian said: \"If [there was] real disarmament on the Korean peninsula, it would be very difficult to not award them the prize.\"The historic meeting between the leaders is a key event of the early twenty-first century. It was the first time ever that leaders from the U.S. and North Korea have met. The two men shook hands, met in private, had lunch together, and signed an agreement for a better future. Some people say they do not deserve the prize. They say the world is less secure because Mr Trump withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement and upset the Iran nuclear deal. Critics also point to human rights issues in North Korea. Other people say South Korea's President Moon Jae-in deserves the prize.", "Scientists are close to making carbon capture work. Carbon capture is taking waste carbon dioxide (CO2) from power plants and storing it so it does not harm the environment. A company called Carbon Engineering say its scientists are close to capturing CO2 from the air and turning it into carbon-neutral fuel. This is a big step forward in the fight against global warming. The scientists also said they have reduced the cost of carbon capture, to as low as $94 per ton of CO2 captured. Scientists used to say carbon capture would cost about $1,000 per ton captured.Carbon Engineering's technology works by sucking air into special towers. CO2 is mixed with a liquid and frozen. It is then heated and mixed with hydrogen. This produces fuels like gasoline and jet fuel. Carbon Engineering's Professor David Keith is hopeful about the future of this process. He thinks his company could fight climate change. He said: \"After 100 years of practical engineering...we can confidently say that...air capture...is a [realistic] and buildable technology for producing carbon-neutral fuels in the immediate future, and for removing carbon in the long run.\" ", "A French man will try to swim across the Pacific Ocean. Ben Lecomte, 51, set off from Japan on Tuesday. It will take him more than six months to finish the 9,000-km swim. He will swim for eight hours a day to get to the west coast of the USA. He will also face many dangers. There will be sharks, jellyfish, storms, rough seas, and very cold water. He will also have to fight exhaustion and any injuries he gets along the way. However, Mr Lecomte  said: \"The mental part is much more important than the physical. You have to make sure you always think about something positive.\"Lecomte trained for six years for this challenge. He has practised every day by swimming in the sea to make sure he is in top physical condition. He also trained his mind. He will be very lonely and he needs to be mentally strong. He is doing the swim to raise awareness of climate change, the effects of plastic rubbish in the ocean, and the effects of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Scientists will check his body to see how so much exercise affects the heart. In 1998, Lecomte made the first solo trans-Atlantic swim. When he reached dry land, his first words were, \"never again\".", "Malaysians gave nearly $2 million to help their country with its national debt. Malaysia has a new party in power for the first time since 1957. It promised to fix the problems left by the past government. One of these problems is the huge national debt. Malaysia's new leaders say the old government lost a lot of money. They want to put that right. The government used a new way of raising money - crowdfunding. This means setting up a special page on the Internet to raise cash. People can give money to the page using their credit card.The $2 million raised so far is very small. It is just a drop in the ocean compared to the country's $251 billion debt. This is about 80 per cent of Malaysia's economy. Malaysia's finance minister said it was important for people to help the country. He said: \"The people voluntarily want to share their earnings with the government to [help].\" The idea came from a 27-year-old Malaysian lady. She said she was, \"very much in love with and proud\" of her country. She started a fundraising effort that very quickly attracted interest from like-minded people who also wanted to help.", "A Korean band reached number one in the U.S. album charts for the first time. The boy band BTS debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart with their new album, \"Love Yourself: Tear\". The seven-member band released their album on May 18. It sold 135,000 copies in the first week, including CDs and streamed music. The album is the second top-10 hit for K-pop. The first was also an album by BTS. The group thanked their fans by tweeting: \"It's wonderful and very overwhelming. Thank you everyone who has listened to our music. We will keep doing our best.\"BTS was formed in 2013. The group quickly became a big success in Korea with their debut song. They won several New Artist of the Year awards. Their popularity soon spread and they started to get many fans in Japan and the USA. They have many followers on social media. In March 2016, they broke the record for the most re-tweeted artist. In December 2017, they were the world's most tweeted about celebrities. They got over half a billion likes or re-tweets. BTS' new album is mostly in Korean. Even though there is little English on the album, they have sold out tours in the USA.", "People say a monster lives in the deep Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands. It is called the Loch Ness Monster, or \"Nessie\" for short. It looks like a dinosaur. It has a small head, a long neck and humps. People first spotted it in 1933. There have been many sightings and some photographs. Scientists will now use a special technique to see if there is such a monster. A research team will use a technique called eDNA sampling to try and find some of Nessie's DNA. A professor says this will show if the monster is real or not.Many scientists have tried to find the monster before. They have even sent equipment to the bottom of the loch, which is 230 metres deep. Nessie is often in the newspapers, however, all of the photographs of Nessie are blurred. Some people say they are car tyres floating in the water. The professor will test water from the loch. He wants to find DNA from the monster's skin, urine and other things. He will check all DNA found and make sure it is not from other animals. If he finds DNA scientists don't know about, that could belong to Nessie.", "Starbucks has a new policy about who can use its cafes. CEO Howard Schultz has announced that anyone can enter a Starbucks in the USA without making a purchase. That means people can sit down or use the restrooms. Mr Schulz told all Starbucks staff to treat everyone in the cafe as a customer. He said: \"Any person who enters our spaces, including...restrooms, regardless of whether they make a purchase, is considered a customer.\" People can use Starbucks to sit down, relax and use the Internet. The new policy is for more than 8,000 cafes in the United States.The new policy will make it easier for cafe managers to do their job. There have been recent cases of managers asking customers to leave a cafe or telling them not to use the bathroom. In April, two black men were led out of a cafe in handcuffs for waiting for a friend to arrive before they ordered. A week later, another black man was told he could not use the bathroom. He posted a video online of a white man using the bathroom without buying anything. Mr Schultz said he didn't want to make Starbucks a public bathroom, but the new policy was \"the right thing\" to do.", "British researchers may be close to a cure for the common cold. Scientists have worked for decades on a medicine to end colds. The biggest problem was finding a drug that could fight hundreds of types of cold viruses. The viruses change very quickly and can fight against new drugs. Until now, there has been no cure for colds, so we all have to suffer every year. Scientists have developed a molecule that could make colds a thing of the past. They found that the molecule blocked the viruses that cause colds. It stopped the viruses from working in the body.Most of us catch a cold a few times a year. The usual treatment for a cold is to take medicine for the different symptoms. We take different things for a sore throat, a runny nose or a fever. Different viruses cause different symptoms. The researchers say the new molecule could stop all symptoms. Researcher Dr Ed Tate said it could help to end suffering for millions of people. Dr Tate believes it could also help people with more serious problems. He said: \"The common cold is an inconvenience for most of us, but it can cause serious complications in people with conditions like asthma.\"", "America's communications commission has fined a man who made nearly 100 million robocalls. A robocall is made by a computer programme. The commission fined the man $120 million. They say he was a threat to public safety. The man's calls were illegal because many of them were made to \"critical emergency phone lines\". Many other calls went to mobile phones and home telephones without the person being called wanting that call. This means the call was a nuisance call. This is like spam e-mail, which is also unwanted and annoying.The man committed a crime. He carried out \"one of the largest and most dangerous illegal robocalling campaigns...ever investigated\". He made 96 million robocalls in three months in 2016. It was part of a \"telemarketing scheme\". He used a technique called \"neighbor spoofing\" to trick people to answer the calls. The people thought the calls were from a local telephone number. He tricked people into believing that the calls were from well-known companies. Callers were passed on to call centres that tried to sell them property. The man said he did nothing wrong.", "Climate scientists in Australia say tourism causes over 8 per cent of greenhouse gasses. They say that this figure will increase because the tourism industry is growing. Their study looked at the carbon footprint of different areas of tourism. It studied the CO2 emissions from transport, events, hotels, restaurants and shopping (including making souvenirs). Researchers spent 18 months on their research. They looked at the tourist activities of 189 countries. A researcher said her team analyzed the impact on the environment of over one million businesses involved in tourism.The researchers said domestic travel caused more CO2 emissions than international travel. Air travel was the largest part of all tourism. Flying will continue to increase emissions as more people become richer. The countries with the biggest tourism carbon footprints were the largest and richest nations - the USA, China, India and Germany. Their carbon emissions will increase as more of their citizens travel. The researchers said holiday-makers should try and reduce their carbon footprint so their vacations cause less harm to the planet.", "A new report by an air-travel information company says Singapore to Kuala Lumpur is the busiest international air route. In the year ending February 2018, 30,537 flights flew between the two cities. There were 84 flights every day - one flight every 17 minutes. The route is covered by national and budget airlines. The flight time between the two cities is under an hour. Asia has the top seven busiest international air routes. Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Seoul and Osaka have the busiest traffic. New York LaGuardia to Toronto, and Dubai to Kuwait were the busiest routes outside of Asia.The report had more statistics on how busy the skies were. The busiest route for passengers was Hong Kong to Taipei. More than 6.5 million people flew this route. Singapore-Jakarta was second, with 4.7 million; followed by Singapore-KL, with 4 million passengers. The world's busiest domestic air route was between Seoul and the Korean island of Jeju.

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi told reporters that the final village in India to get electricity was the remote Leisang village in Manipur state. It was connected to the grid on Sunday. Electrification of India's villages was a big government promise. Mr Modi thanked everyone involved in the project. He said: \"April 28, 2018 will be remembered as a historic day in the development...of India....We [kept a promise], due to which, the lives of...Indians will be [changed] forever. I am delighted that every single village...has...electricity.\"Mr Modi promised to give 18,000 villages electricity for the first time. He said a village is electrified when it has basic power lines and 10 per cent of its houses and public places (including schools and health centres) have power. Mr Modi is happy, but many people say there is more work to be done. The World Bank says 200 million Indians still have no electricity. The \"India Today\" newspaper found that many villages lacked electricity.

Amazon has a new children's version of its virtual assistant Alexa. It is called \"FreeTime\". The child-friendly device will include a \"Magic Word\" feature. Actually, there are two magic words: \"Please,\" and: \"Thank you.\" The software is programmed to encourage children to say these two words when they ask the device questions. If a child asks FreeTime: \"What is the capital city of Australia?\" Alexa will answer and end its response with: \"Thank you for asking so nicely.\" Amazon hopes children will copy the device and be more polite.The Magic Word feature is for people who think technology teaches children to be rude. Many smart devices say sentences without using any polite words. Parents say children copy this and forget to say \"please\" or \"thank you\". Children also ask smart devices questions without being polite. Not everyone is happy with this new technology. The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood said: \"AI devices [get in the way of] face-to-face interactions and child-driven play that children need to grow.\" It said parents should spend time with children and teach them politeness.", "There is a special job for eight people who love riding motorbikes, hot summers, and feeling the wind in their hair.

It could shorten our life. The study was done in the UK. Researchers spent six-and-a-half years looking at 430,000 adults between the ages of 38 and 73. The researchers compared the deaths of people who went to bed early to those who went to bed late. Night owls (people who go to bed late) were 10 per cent more likely to die during the period of the study. The researchers said that night owls were at a higher risk of poor health or an early death compared to early birds (people who sleep and wake up early).The researchers said working hours should change to reduce the risks for night owls. A researcher said: \"This is a public health issue that can no longer be ignored.\" He said night owls should start and finish work later in the day so they could sleep longer in the morning. He said night owls were more likely to suffer from mental problems, diabetes, and breathing problems. They were also more likely to smoke, drink alcohol and take drugs. Researchers also said different sleeping patterns at weekends could increase the chances of health problems for night owls.", "Saudi Arabia will have its first orchestra and opera.

It hopes more people will like her fashion sense and buy clothes from its charity shops.", "New technology is reducing children's ability to use a pencil. Researchers from the UK's health service said that children spend so much time swiping iPads or mobile phone screens that they cannot hold a pencil properly. This means their hands do not have the muscle strength to be able to write properly. Researcher Dr Sally Payne said: \"Children are not coming into school with the hand strength...they had 10 years ago. Children coming into school are being given a pencil but are increasingly not able to hold it because they don't have the...skills.\"Technology is changing the way that children write, draw or make things. Children are now using technology to create. Dr Payne explained that: \"It's easier to give a child an iPad than encourage them to do muscle-building play such as building blocks, cutting and sticking, or pulling toys and ropes [so] they're not developing the...skills they need to grip and hold a pencil.\" Some experts say technology is causing bigger problems. One expert said if a child isn't strong enough to hold a pencil, perhaps their whole body is weak.

He published his final theory called \"A Smooth Exit from Eternal Inflation\". He explained two ideas. The first was how humans might be able to find multiverses. These are other universes that were made at the same time as our universe, after the Big Bang. The second theory is about how our universe will end, when the stars run out of energy. Scientists say his paper could be his most important ever, and that he could have won a Nobel Prize for it.Hawking explained his older theory called inflation. This is when our universe was made from a tiny point in space into the billions of stars we have today. Hawking suggested there were many big bangs and each of them made its own universe. He called this collection of universes a multiverse. Hawking believed scientists could find the multiverse by using sensors on space ships.

Engineers have invented the \"Super Monster Wolf\" to scare away wild animals from crops of rice, pumpkin and sweet potato. The solar-powered scarecrow robot looks like a real wolf. It has wolf-like hair, big scary teeth and red eyes with infrared sensors. It also has 48 different wolf howls so animals never get used to it. Super Monster Wolf will keep animals like wild boar and deer out of rice paddies, farms and fruit orchards. Farmers lose millions of dollars every year because of hungry animals.Japan's agricultural association (JA) trialled the Super Monster Wolf in nine locations. A JA spokesman said the robot wolf greatly reduced crop losses. He said it was more effective than electric fences at keeping animals out. The robot can sense movement up to one kilometre away and make its scary sounds. The 65cm-long robot will start being made from next month. The price is $4,800 but farmers will be able to rent the wolf by the month.

Most people would never eat the peel of a banana. However, banana farmers in Japan created a technique of growing bananas with a peel we can eat. The new method is called the \"freeze-thaw awakening\" technique. Farmers in the west of Japan keep their banana trees at a freezing temperature of -60\u00b0C. The farmers then put the trees in 27\u00baC temperatures. The big change in temperature makes the tree suddenly grow. It grows too quickly for the peel to fully develop. This makes the skin thin and soft enough to eat.The new banana is called the \"Mongee\". Farmers are selling it in bunches of 10 bananas. They are not cheap. One banana costs yen 650 (about six dollars). The farmers have not grown many of them, so the price is high. They want to grow more, so this means the price will come down. Bananas are Japan's most popular fruit. Japan imports about 99% of its bananas. The Mongee could mean Japanese people will eat more bananas that are grown in Japan. The Mongee banana skin is very sweet. It contains nutrients such as vitamin B6 and magnesium.", "Shoppers in France have been fighting each other to buy the hazelnut spread Nutella.

A big supermarket chain said: \"We are working closely with our suppliers to manage supply as much as possible.\"", "A study said mothers across the world speak to their babies in the same way. Researchers from the Baby Lab at Princeton University said \"motherese\" is a universal language. It is not just cute noises and coochy-coos. The words and sounds mothers say to babies are quite complex. They are a special form of communication. Mothers use them in the same way across the world. They help the language development in babies. Dr Elise Piazza, co-author of the research, said baby talk is more important than we thought. She said: \"It is not something to be embarrassed about at all.\"The researchers recorded 24 different mothers talking to babies aged between seven months and one year. The mothers spoke 10 different languages, including English, Mandarin and Russian. Dr Piazza said: \"We basically brought mothers into the lab and had them play with and read to their own babies, just like they would at home.\" She said mothers changed the quality of their voices when speaking to babies, in any language. The study didn't look at fathers' talk, but Piazza said that it is likely fathers would also speak to their babies in a similar way across the world.", "Everyone knows that young children don't like eating greens. It is difficult for parents to get their children to eat vegetables like broccoli. A new study explains why this is. The study looked at the eating habits of two- to four-year-olds. The study found that two genes can make children dislike greens. The genes can make some youngsters dislike new food, so they become fussy eaters. It found that not liking greens is because of a child's genes. This means parents do not have to stress if their children do not eat vegetables. Many parents worry because their children do not eat healthily.The study found that changes in DNA changes how small children taste things. Children think many green vegetables taste bitter. Natasha Cole, a member of an obesity prevention program said it was not surprising that some children have a sensitive taste. She said this makes them think things like broccoli are bitter. She said the new research could help to find new ways of fighting obesity in children. Ms Cole says there needs to be more research. She said: \"There is a huge gap in the research when children [move] from a milk-based diet to foods that the rest of the family eats.\"", "The Nobel Prize in chemistry has gone to three scientists for their work with molecules. The scientists will share the $1,090,000 prize. They found a special way of taking photos of molecules. Molecules are the smallest building blocks in the cells in our body. Everything and everyone is made of molecules. The scientists developed a technique called cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This lets scientists zoom in to amazing new levels. Scientists can now see things in our bodies never seen before. They can see how the building blocks of life move. The Nobel Prize committee said the new technique will change science forever. The technique has \"moved biochemistry into a new era\". It added: \"Soon, there will be no more secrets. Now we can see the\u2026details of [molecules] in every corner of our cells and every drop of our body fluids. We can understand how they are built and how they act and how they work together\u2026.We are facing a revolution in biochemistry.\" A professor said there were many practical uses for the technique. Scientists can now look at the building blocks of viruses and find cures for many diseases.", "A law in Austria has banned full-face veils. Muslim women cannot wear a full-face veil in public. The law says faces must be visible from the hairline to the chin. The government said the law is to protect Austrian values. Muslim groups said the law is unfair because it is against human rights and religious freedom. Only a small minority of Austrian Muslims wears full-face veils. The groups say the number is about 150. Officials say the law will damage Austria's economy. Many Muslim tourists might decide not to visit Austria. Austria is the third European country to ban the veil. France and Belgium introduced bans in 2011. Other European countries could follow. Holland is working on passing a ban. Germany's Angela Merkel said the full-face veil should be banned, \"wherever it is legally possible\". The Islamic Religious Community in Austria talked about the unfairness of the new law. It said the \"handful\" of veiled women in Austria are now \"criminals\" and have to stay in their home. A supporter of the ban said: \"It's not right that those living here don't show their faces.\"", "Scientists say that many of the world's plants are in danger of dying out \u2013 of becoming extinct. Dr Paul Smith said one in five of the world's plants is in danger. Botanic gardens contain about 100,000 species, including a third of all the world's endangered plants. Botanic gardens help to protect many endangered and rare plants. Dr Smith said: \"This is the first time that we have [looked] at the wide range of plants grown, managed and conserved in botanic gardens. For the first time we know what we have and, perhaps more importantly, what is missing from botanic gardens.\"Researcher Dr Samuel Brockington said botanic gardens were the best hope for saving the world's endangered plants. He said: \"One-fifth of plant diversity is under threat, yet there is no technical reason why any plant species should become extinct.\" If we do not protect plants, people could have trouble finding food in the future. Dr Brockington said: \"If we do not conserve our plant diversity, humanity will struggle to solve the global challenges of food\u2026security\u2026and climate change.\" Plants are in danger because of humans cutting down forests and climate change.", "Police said a man who bombed a London subway train bought most of the bomb parts online. Police accused an 18-year-old Iraqi refugee of bombing a busy commuter train. The bomber left the bomb on a packed train during the rush hour. It exploded at Parsons Green station at 8.20am. About 30 passengers had burns to their face and body. Police said there would be more people hurt if the bomb had worked properly. It didn't detonate fully. Police said the bomb contained, \"knives, screws, glass and similar items to increase the likelihood of death\".The bomber bought many of the ingredients for his bomb from Amazon. One ingredient was several hundred grams of an explosive called TATP. It is called \"Mother of Satan\" because it is so powerful. Police said the bomber wanted to create \"maximum destruction\". Reporters checked Amazon and were shocked to find that the site directed visitors to other things that could be used to make bombs. Amazon said it will stop this happening, saying: \"In light of recent events, we are reviewing our website to ensure that all these products are presented in an appropriate [way].\"", "A study says today's teenagers are growing up more slowly than before. Researchers looked at data on the behaviour of 8 million teens in seven different countries over the past 40 years. They said that compared to teenagers from the 70s, 80s and 90s, today's teens, \"are taking longer to engage in both the pleasures and the responsibilities of adulthood\". A professor said: \"The whole developmental pathway has slowed down.\" She said today's 18-year-olds are more like how 15-year-olds used to be. She said teenagers are taking a lot fewer risks than they did before.Today's teenagers are taking longer to do things their parents did. They are older when they date, less likely to work part-time, and less likely to drive. The professor said they have a, \"slow life strategy\". More teenagers are living with their parents instead of renting their own room. One of the reasons for this behaviour is how much time teenagers spend online. The Internet is keeping teens on social media, looking at videos or playing games instead of living in the \"real world\". Another reason is parents do too much for their children and protect them too much.", "New research says bald and balding men should not worry about their looks. Many men get stressed about losing their hair. However, research from the University of Pennsylvania shows that women and men think bald men are more attractive, more confident and taller. Researchers asked people to rate photos of men. There were three categories - attractiveness, confidence and dominance. Bald men came top in every category. The study said: \"[Bald] men were viewed as nearly [2 centimetres] taller and 13 per cent stronger.\"The researchers said bald men could do better in life because they have no hair. They could be more successful in negotiations because they look stronger. However, there is some bad news for bald men. A bald or shaved head makes a man look about four years older. An American hair loss group said 85 per cent of men will be going bald by the age of 50. Men might not need to spend billions of dollars every year trying to stop hair loss. Instead, they should be happy to be bald. Researchers said: \"Men might improve their well-being by finishing what Mother Nature has started.\"", "The UN has said Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar are facing a catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled over the border to Bangladesh. The UN Secretary-General said the Rohingya are being attacked by Myanmar's security forces. Over 379,000 Rohingyas have fled the violence since last month. The BBC said whole villages have been burned down. The Myanmar army said it isn't targeting the Rohingya. The Rohingya are a mostly Muslim people. They have lived in Rakhine state for hundreds of years, but Myanmar calls them illegal immigrants.Many people are asking Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi to help the Rohingya. They want her Nobel Peace Prize to be taken away if she doesn't act. They say she cannot keep the prize while the Rohingya are suffering in her country. Ms Suu Kyi has not criticized the attacks on the Rohingya. Bangladesh has asked Myanmar to take the Rohingya refugees back. However, the Myanmar army said Myanmar couldn't do that. A spokesman said Buddhists are the original people of Rakhine state and have been living there, \"since the time of their forefathers\".", "Archaeologists have found a tomb with three mummies inside it. The tomb is over 3,500 years old. The mummies are a woman and her two sons, who were in their 20s and 30s. Archaeologists say the tomb belonged to a royal goldsmith called Amenemhat. The woman may be his wife. There was a statue of the goldsmith, sitting beside the woman. The tomb is near the city of Luxor on the River Nile. Luxor is 700km south of Egypt's capital Cairo. Archaeologists say the woman was about 50 when she died. The woman died because of a bone disease. All three bodies were in very good condition.The site that contains Amenemhat's tomb had a courtyard and two burial shafts. A team of Egyptian archaeologists found it. The team spent six years digging on the site. Archaeologist Dr Yousef Khalifa told Arab News: \"Luxor alone has one-third of the world's ancient monuments and visitors will enjoy exploring the newly found ancient Egyptian relics.\" Dr Khalifa thinks the new mummies will help Egypt's tourism industry. He said many tourists will come to see them. Egypt's head of antiquities, Dr Khaled al-Anani, hopes archaeologists will find more mummies in the area.", "Russia's Vladimir Putin warned that the North Korean crisis could cause a \"planetary catastrophe\".

It found that yawning is contagious, powerful and unstoppable. People automatically yawn when they see other people yawn. Researchers said people yawn more when they try to stop yawning. They also found that some people want to yawn a lot more than other people. Lead researcher Professor Stephen Jackson said that even reading about yawning could make people yawn. You might even want to yawn right now.The researchers studied the actions and brain activity of 36 adults. The adults looked at videos of people yawning. They then had to yawn or stop themselves yawning. The volunteers were videoed as they did either of these. The researchers also checked the brain activity of the adults and checked how much they wanted to yawn. Jackson said understanding more about yawning will help to treat illnesses such as dementia and epilepsy. He said: \"We are looking for potential non-drug, personalized treatments\u2026that might be effective in [changing] imbalances in the brain.\"", "A Nigerian scientist has made a revolutionary new computer that has artificial intelligence. Dr Oshi Agabi spent years trying to make a computer that can smell. He called his project Koniku. He has raised over $1 million. Dr Agabi said his project has made profits of $10 million. Technology companies like Google and Microsoft are interested in it. Security companies are also interested. Koniku will be in drones and smell bombs and explosives. It will also be in airport security systems. An additional use will be in hospitals to smell diseases in humans.Dr Agabi did not base Koniku on silicon chips. He said silicon chips are not powerful enough for the maths needed to recognize smells. Agabi based his device on brain neurons from mice. Neurons are brain cells that share information. They use electricity and chemicals to send information. Using neurons in computers is called biotechnology. Agabi said: \"Biology is technology. Bio is tech.

There has been a 45 per cent surge in anti-Semitic crime since 2014. Anti-Semitism is hostility towards or discrimination against Jews. New research shows that only 59 per cent of British Jews feel welcome in the UK, their home. More than 10,000 British Jews were interviewed in the study. Around 40 per cent of Britain's Jews said they were afraid and hid their religion in public. The research is from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism (CAA).More than three-quarters in the study believed that one of Britain's political parties has increased anti-Semitism. They believed the Labour Party's negative opinions on Israel created bad feeling towards Jews. They said its leader has not controlled anti-Semitism in the party. In addition, fewer than 24 anti-Semitic crimes go to court each year. The CAA warned: \"Without urgent change, British Jews may start to leave, as has happened elsewhere in Europe.\" The UK government said: \"There can never be an excuse for hatred towards the Jewish community\u2026.We shall oppose and challenge it.\"", "A Chinese man bought 5,000 people a free bowl of noodles.

Benjamin David, 40, now beats the traffic by swimming 2km down the Isar River in Munich, Germany. He puts his laptop, phone and his suit in a waterproof bag that he drags behind him. David got the idea by watching the river outside his apartment. He looked on a map and realized the river went past his office. He decided to swim to work and get some exercise. This was better than fighting commuters on buses and trains or breathing fumes from traffic while cycling.David's river commute has changed his life. He is fitter and less stressed. Commuting used to make him stressed. He said: \"I'm not a monk. When I was on my bike, I would yell at cars. When I was on foot, I would yell at cyclists, and so on.\" He said: \"Just a few metres to the side of [all the traffic] is the river, and if you just swim down that, it's completely relaxing and refreshing.\" David spoke about the dangers of river swimming. He always checks the water temperature. Not everyone can swim to work in the city.

The war of words between Mr Trump and North Korea is getting worse. Countries in the region are worried that the war of words could turn into a real war. Tensions increased a lot this week when North Korea said it had nuclear warheads small enough to fit inside its missiles. Trump then warned: \"North Korea best not make any more threats\u2026.They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.\" North Korea responded by promising to fire missiles off the coast of the US territory of Guam.North Korea said Trump's words were \"nonsense\". Mr Trump then warned the North Koreans again.  He said his \"fire and fury\" statement \"wasn't tough enough\" and that North Korea should \"be very, very nervous\". He said China could do more to reduce tensions. The USA's Arms Control Association said Mr Trump should stop using such strong words to avoid a military conflict.

Researchers tried to find out how loneliness affected the risk of dying early. People can be lonely even if they are with family and friends. Researchers also looked at the dangers of social isolation. This is when people have little or no contact with others. The research showed that the risk of an early death was 50 per cent lower for people who mixed with friends and family. Researchers said loneliness, social isolation, and living alone were all linked to an increased risk of early death.The researchers said loneliness, social isolation, and living alone could be more dangerous than obesity. A professor said the research is worrying because the population is getting older. She said: \"Many nations\u2026suggest we are facing a 'loneliness epidemic'. The challenge\u2026is what can be done about it.\" She suggested that one thing to help\u2026is to teach social skills to children in schools.

The new law starts in October. It says: \"No pedestrian shall cross a street or highway while viewing a mobile electronic device.\" This includes tablets and digital cameras. People breaking this law will get a fine of $15-$35. People who break it for a second time will get a $99 fine. The new bill is called the Distracted Walking Law. Honolulu's mayor Kirk Caldwell said the law was because of the high number of injuries and deaths when pedestrians use mobile devices.Lawmakers called people who text while walking, \"phone zombies\". Mr Caldwell said the ban was to make people more aware of the dangers of texting while walking. He said that unfortunately, many pedestrians in Honolulu have accidents while crossing the road. Caldwell said: \"Sometimes I wish there were laws we did not have to pass, that perhaps common sense would [exist], but sometimes we lack common sense.\" Another lawmaker said we have technology but we forget about the real problem of safety.

The dirt helps small kids to build their immune system. Gilbert said children often get allergies because parents try too hard to clean everything that children use. He said parents now sterilize everything in the home too much. This makes children's immune systems very sensitive, which can lead to things like asthma and food allergies. Gilbert defended the \"five-second rule\". That is when you eat something that fell on the floor for fewer than five seconds. Gilbert says that is OK as long as the floor isn't really dirty.

They collected dust samples from 11 different houses. Dust from nine of the houses made the mice fatter. The scientists said the house dust changed the hormones in the mice so that they made more fat in their body. The scientists said we breathe in and swallow small amounts of dust. A researcher said amounts of dust as small as three micrograms made the mice fatter.Dust contains chemicals called EDCs. These can change or copy the body's hormones. They are in sofas and carpets and some plastics, to make them bend more. They are also in cosmetics, food packaging, and household cleaners. EDCs are everywhere in most houses. Researchers say they can affect our health. Children are at most risk and can lead to learning disabilities. Studies also show that EDCs can increase the risk of cancer and infertility.

They found a \"toxic cocktail\" of chemicals that would kill any living thing. The chemicals are on the surface of the Red Planet. The scientists say the discovery of the chemicals means the chance of finding life on Mars is lower. The scientists are astrobiologists \u2013 they study the places in the universe that might support life. Mars has no ozone layer, which means there are high levels of ultra-violet (UV) radiation. The mix of UV radiation and the chemicals means it might be possible for anything to grow on Mars.The scientists tested what happens when the chemicals mix with UV rays. They found that just the chemicals were enough to kill living things. When the chemicals mix with UV rays, the mix kills living things 11 times faster. The scientists said: \"Our [findings] show that the surface of\u2026Mars is highly [harmful] to cells, caused by a toxic cocktail of [chemicals] and UV radiation.\" They say their research is evidence that the land on Mars is deadly to any kind of plant life.

It is on the attractive Ninen-zaka shopping street between two UNESCO World Heritage-listed temples. The area is popular with tourists. Some of them wear Japanese kimono to go sightseeing in. Starbucks wants to make sure its shop blends in with its traditional surroundings. There are no neon signs or giant logos. Instead, there is a traditional dark-blue curtain over the front door with a black logo printed on it. Starbucks reformed the house in the traditional style and created a Japanese garden for people to look at. The company wants to be a good neighbor. It will not let people line up in front of the shop as they wait to get in. It will also limit the number of customers during the busiest times. This is to make sure the atmosphere in the area is quiet.", "The president of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina, has won the 2017 World Food Prize. He also won $250,000. He got the prize for his work in increasing food production in Africa. He used his experience as a top banker to change many farming laws and made it easier for small farmers to get business loans. He also helped farmers grow their crops in a more modern way. The World Food Prize Foundation said Mr Adesina won the prize, \"for driving change in African agriculture for over 25 years and improving food security for millions across the continent\".The 1970 Nobel Peace Prize winner created the World Food Prize. He is known as the father of the \"green revolution\". He created crops that produced more food and were better at fighting disease. They helped to stop famine in Asia in the 1960s.

Some are round, some are potato-shaped, and others are pointy. Two thousand years ago, Aristotle said flatter eggs had female chicks inside and rounder eggs contained male chicks. But he was wrong. A new study says that the shape of the egg depends on how well the female bird flies. A professor said she noticed that birds have evolved to lay eggs that have different shapes. They are all different in form, \"everything from a spherical owl egg to a pointy sandpiper egg\".The professor and her team made a formula for the shape of different eggs. They looked at 50,000 eggs from 1,400 different bird species. They put the shape, length and height of the eggs into a computer. They also looked at how oval the eggs were. The researchers found that the birds with the most-oval-shaped eggs were the best fliers. The professor said: \"We were shocked to see that one of the best explanations for egg shape [difference] was flight ability.\" Hummingbirds laid the most-oval-shaped eggs; owls laid the roundest eggs; and sea birds laid the pointiest eggs.", "YouTube has a plan \"to fight online terror\".

Google's senior vice president announced four things YouTube would do about the problem of dangerous videos. Google's answer is called: \"Four steps we're taking today to fight online terror.\" The first steps will find and delete videos that might help terrorists. Another step is to find videos that could get people to become terrorists. Finally, step four is to show \"anti-terrorism\" adverts.There are many problems with these steps. It is a huge task to look at so many videos on YouTube. Over one hour of video is uploaded each second. An advertising company said one hundred years' of video is uploaded every 10 days. Another problem is that many of the videos Google wants to target are not illegal. Terrorists could easily use a BBC news video in the wrong way.

It tricks our skin into making it darker so we get a suntan. The drug gets our body to make a natural pigment called melanin. A pigment is what gives our skin its colour. Plants also have pigments that give them different colours. The scientists are from a hospital in the USA. They say their drug could be good for our health. The biggest benefits could be to prevent skin cancer and slow down how old people look. Getting a suntan can give us skin cancer, make our skin look old and give us wrinkles.The scientists said the drug could safely give us a suntan because it has no harmful UV rays. UV rays burn our skin and damage it. The rays make light-skinned people turn red. The drug gets the body to make dark melanin. This darkens our skin and makes it look tanned. Melanin is the body's natural sunblock. It protects the skin from UV radiation and cancer. A researcher said the drug could help fight skin cancer. This is the most common type of cancer. The researcher said: \"Dark pigment is associated with a lower risk of all forms of skin cancer.\"", "There will be more mixed-gender events and women at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said mixed-gender events would be in archery, athletics, judo, sailing, shooting, swimming, table tennis, and triathlon. There will be mixed relays in athletics and swimming. Olympics swimming champion Adam Peaty told the BBC that: \"It's something that would make things a little bit more fun\u2026.It's great to mix things up from what they've been for so long as it adds a little spice and [mixed events] are great to watch.\"There will also be more sports at the Tokyo Olympics. Spokesman Thomas Bach said the Games will be \"more youthful, more urban and include more women\". Not everyone wants the new events, especially urban sports like skateboarding, 3-on-3 basketball, sport climbing and BMX freestyle. These are to try and get more young people to watch the Games. The newer sports means there will be fewer athletes in traditional events like weightlifting and wrestling. There will be more women competing in Tokyo. Women will make up 48.8 per cent of the athletes.", "Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, the UAE, Libya and Yemen have all cut ties with Qatar. They say Qatar gives money and support to terrorist groups. Saudi Arabia said it has to protect its own security. It said Qatar was home to many \"terrorist...groups that aim to create instability in the region\". Qatar said this was not true and that there are no facts that show that terrorist groups are in Qatar. It said the other Arab countries are acting unfairly towards Qatar. It also said other Arab countries would, \"not affect the normal lives of citizens and residents\" in Qatar.Qatar now has a difficult future, until normal relations return. Air, land and sea links from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain have closed. This will be a problem for people in Qatar. Most of its food enters from Saudi Arabia. There is now a rush to buy food in supermarkets. Qatar Airways will suffer because it has to change its routes. Many flights will take much longer.

The Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) found that the world became 0.28% more peaceful in the past year. The IEP has reported on world peace for 10 years. Every year, it publishes its Global Peace Index (GPI). This ranks 163 countries and territories on how peaceful they are. It also gives advice on how to be peaceful. Iceland is the most peaceful country in the world. It has been number one since 2008. The next four most peaceful countries are New Zealand, Portugal, Austria and Denmark.The report says that 93 countries have become more peaceful, and 68 became more violent. Researchers looked at many things to work out the level of peace. They looked at the murder rate, how easy it was to get weapons, terrorism, and the number of soldiers in each country. Syria is the least peaceful country. It has now been bottom of the list for five years. The next four most violent countries are Afghanistan, Iraq, South Sudan and Yemen.

Its name is 'RoboCop'. It is part of the Dubai Police force. Robocop's first official job was to greet guests at a security conference. It also answered questions and gave directions. RoboCop has a built-in tablet for people to interact with, pay traffic fines and use other police services. The tablet is linked to a police station, so people can talk to real police officers. The 170-centimetre-tall RoboCop can speak six languages. It can also shake hands, salute people and recognize people's emotions and facial expressions.RoboCop is the first of many robot police officers for Dubai. By 2030, 25 per cent of the Dubai Police force will be robots. By 2030, Dubai will have the first smart police station. No humans will work there. A spokesman said: \"The RoboCop is the latest smart addition to the police force and has been designed to help us fight crime, keep the city safe and improve happiness levels.\" RoboCop will also, \"assist and help people in the malls or on the streets\". An official at the security conference commented that: \"The age of the robots is no longer coming. It has arrived.\"", "Scientists think they have found how flamingos stand on one leg. We all love the image of these beautiful birds doing this. The reason why the birds do this has always puzzled scientists. Researchers in the USA say they have found this secret of the natural world. A professor says a flamingo can stand on one leg for many hours because of its skeleton. The flamingo's hips and leg bones are in a special position that gives the bird great balance. The professor said the flamingo's bones help it to stand on one leg. Flamingos do not have to use their muscles a lot to do this.Another researcher said the flamingo is unique because it can stand still for a long time on one leg. It is very difficult for a human to stay still, even for an hour. The researcher said most of us don't know that we're moving all the time. Even when we stand still, our muscles always work to keep us straight so we don't fall over. The position of the bones in a flamingo means the birds do not need to use so many muscles to keep still. They can save energy. The researchers say that saving energy could be the reason why other birds also stand on one leg.", "German football now has the first female referee in Europe's top leagues. Germany's Bundesliga promoted Bibiana Steinhaus from the lower divisions of German football. She is very happy to be the first top-flight female referee. She said: \"It's a dream come true.

She said: \"I am aware that I\u2026will be closely watched by the media\". She added: \"I'm used to pressure and am convinced I will find my feet quickly.\"Steinhaus has a lot of experience as a referee. She has refereed Bundesliga 2 matches since 2011. She also refereed a women\u2019s World Cup final and the women's gold medal match at the London Olympic games in 2012. After she heard about her promotion, she said: \"I was quite speechless. I feel disbelief, joy, happiness, relief and curiosity. It was simply a roller-coaster ride of emotions.\" She added: \"It has always been my dream to be a Bundesliga referee. That this dream will come true naturally fills me with joy.\" Steinhaus will next referee the Women\u2019s Champions League final.", "Microsoft is angry with America's National Security Agency (NSA). Microsoft said the WannaCry ransomware cyber-attack was because the NSA keeps cyber-weapons on its computers. Ransomware is a harmful software that blocks access to computers until the owner pays money (a ransom) to the hackers. The NSA is a military intelligence organization. It helps America's communications and information systems to stay safe. It also stops cyber-attacks against the USA. However, experts say the WannaCry ransomware used spying tools that were designed by the NSA. Microsoft said governments must wake up to the problem of storing cyber-weapons. It said hackers can steal them and it was as dangerous as stealing missiles. Microsoft's president said: \"This attack provides yet another example of why [governments keeping these things]\u2026is such a problem.\" Europe's police agency said WannaCry has affected 200,000 computers in 150 countries. It made many problems for Britain's National Health Service. Many operations were cancelled.

Researchers from a university in New Zealand say doing the haka and speaking two languages (Maori and English) might help Maoris avoid dementia. A study compared rates of dementia among people in their 80s and 90s. Researchers thought these rates would be higher among Maoris. This is because Maoris have less health care, less income and more heart diseases than non-Maoris. However, researchers found no differences between Maoris and non-Maoris.The haka is a traditional war cry. A group of people all chant and repeat the same energetic movements while stamping their feet. Warriors did it before battles. They wanted to show their strength and frighten their enemy. A New Zealand football team started using it in 1888. The famous All Blacks rugby team then started using it before their matches in 1905. It is now part of the pre-match preparations for the All Blacks. A Maori professor said that skill, eye co-ordination and the difficult dance routines of the haka help to keep the brain healthy.", "The singer Nicki Minaj, 34, told millions of Twitter followers she would pay university tuition fees for some of them if they get A-grades.

It could also increase the performance of those who do exercise. The scientists are from a biological studies institute in California. They say the pill could produce the same benefits to the body that it gets from running. It could make us healthier. It could give us more stamina, fat loss, a better mood, a healthier heart and a longer lifespan \u2013 all without exercising. The scientists said the pill helped to increase athletic performance in mice by 70 per cent. This could be good news for people who want to exercise more.The scientists looked at how the body changes with exercise.

The government is testing a new project to help people, especially women, who want to work more. Employees who work extra hours will get vouchers. These are to get help with the housework, such as cleaning, ironing, vacuuming and dusting. The project will help to support family life and to reduce the shadow economy. The shadow economy is when people pay for things in cash but do not pay tax on them. This means the government loses money.A government spokesman explained that qualified women work fewer hours than they want to because they do housework and look after the family. He said if these women worked five to ten hours more, they would get a government voucher and could then afford to pay someone to help with the housework. He added that the new system would mean more jobs for people in the household-help industry and create more tax for the government. Another spokesman said: \"With professional help in the home, it is easier to balance work and family life.\"", "The Vice President of the USA, Mike Pence, has said US-North Korea relations have changed.

Millions of us spend time and money on it, but is it necessary? Fewer people are using shampoo because they are changing their hair-washing habits. A study by a consumer analyst company said: \"People are working from home\u2026and fewer people are smoking, so [they] are using less shampoo less frequently.\" A hair website said shampooing regularly may be why hair gets so greasy. It makes the scalp dry, so the head produces more oil, which you have to shampoo again to remove. Shampooing less often can mean less oil.Many people say shampoo is good for the hair. A top hairdresser in the UK said there is no benefit to not washing your hair. He said shampoo is gentle on your head and it helps the hair to look glossy. He added that the hair's oil may help it look shiny, but it doesn't clean it. A London hair loss clinic said: \"Rinsing your hair is not going to be very effective after certain activities that make the scalp sweaty, such as exercising or using a sauna.\" It added: \"Rinsing will also not remove bacteria or clean the [extra] oil from your scalp if you have greasy hair.\"", "New research says that children of older mothers grow up to be happier. It also says children will have fewer behavioural, social and emotional problems. Researchers from a university in Denmark looked at data from 4,741 mothers. The lead researcher said we are, \"more mentally flexible\" and more tolerant of others as we get older. He said this could be why older mothers do not scold and hit their children as much as younger mothers. He added that, \"this style of parenting can [lead] to a positive psycho-social environment\" as the child grows up.The research said the average age of the mothers when pregnant was 31. Older mothers worry less during pregnancy. They are usually happier and more positive about becoming parents and about children. This may mean they are more caring. Older mothers also have more stable relationships; they have more money; and they have a better education. Researchers also found that children with older mothers have better language skills than those with younger mothers. This may be because older mothers spend more time with their children and talk to them more.", "Scientists from Bristol University have found a way to mass produce blood that is good enough for hospital patients. For many years, they could produce blood in a laboratory. However, the process to do that was very slow and they could not make a lot of blood.

A study from Pennsylvania State University says the Earth's climate could change the shape of our nose. The study found that people with wider noses usually live in warm, humid areas. People with narrower noses more commonly live in colder, drier places. The nose is important in making sure the air we breathe gets to our lungs in a warm and moist condition. The shape of the nose makes sure this happens. The nose is a little like a temperature controller.Researchers used 3D images to measure the nose width and height, and the distance between the two nostrils of over 2,600 people from Africa, Asia and Europe. The researchers said their study could help people to adjust to the heat or cold, and the humidity if they travel to or live in other countries. It could help with breathing problems.

If the answer to this question is 'no,' help may be near. A new study says anyone can upgrade their memory if they train their brain. Scientists say that we can train our brain to be a \"memory athlete,\" like athletes train to be champions. Scientist Martin Dresler said just six weeks of brain training can give people an incredible ability to remember things. Dr Dresler suggested people could train their brain to enter the World Memory Championships that are held in March every year.Dr Dresler compared MRI scans of the brains of 23 of the world's memory champions with the brains of \"normal\" people. He wanted to see if the champions had different brains. He was surprised to find no differences. This made him think we can all become memory athletes if we train. Dresler studied people who did 40 days of daily 30-minute training using a memory technique called mnemonics. They more than doubled their memory capacity. Mnemonics is a very old method that helps people remember things, especially in lists.

For two months, listeners could only listen to classical music or folk songs that were over 70 years old. A copyright dispute meant the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) could not play pop music. Listeners could only listen to music that was recorded before World War II. In the European Union, copyright disappears 70 years after an artist's death. BNR signed a deal with the copyright organization and will pay more royalty fees. these fees goes to the singer, composer or songwriter of a song or a piece of music every time the radio plays their song. During the two-month dispute, the number of listeners to BNR's shows increased by 20 per cent. It seems many listeners are more interested in listening to older music like Bulgarian folk tunes, classical music and pre-war jazz than Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. BNR is now thinking about changing the music it plays on its shows. The boss of BNR, Aleksandar Velev, said there could be new radio stations. Mr Velev told reporters: \"We will not change the profiles of the current radio shows.

Fasting is eating or drinking little or nothing for a short period of time - 24 hours or sometimes a few days. The tests were done at universities in the USA and Italy. Scientists found that fasting in mice can lower the risk of diabetes, heart disease, cancer and other diseases. The scientists fed mice for four days on a diet low in calories, protein and carbohydrates but high in fat. They then gave the mice just 10% of their normal food for three days. The scientists found this made the pancreas in the mice work better.The pancreas is the organ that uses special beta cells to produce the hormone insulin. The body uses insulin to break down sugar in the blood. People with diabetes cannot produce enough insulin so they have health problems and it can be deadly. There is too much sugar in their blood. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas stops producing insulin. In type 2 diabetes, either not enough insulin is produced or the insulin has no effect. Scientists said the fasting mice produced increased amounts of insulin. They said their results were promising and tests now needed to be done on humans.", "Has getting tomato ketchup out the bottle made you angry? Have you ever squeezed the toothpaste tube but the last bit wouldn\u2019t come out? Have you ever spent ages trying to get jam off the sides of the jar? If the answer is 'yes,' you may be happy to know that a solution to your problems is coming.

Now we may have to change how many continents there are. We are taught there are seven - Asia, Africa, North and South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. Geologists now say there is an eighth continent - Zealandia. This is a big, largely underwater landmass in the Pacific Ocean. Six per cent of it is above water and is New Zealand and New Caledonia. The rest is under the ocean. It is five million square kilometres, which scientists say is big enough to be a continent.Geologists explained why Zealandia is a continent in a research paper in the Geological Society of America's Journal. They argue that the land does not have to be above water to be a continent. They said Zealandia is a continent because of four points: It is a lot higher than the area around it, it has a special geology, it is easy to see its shape, and it is thicker than the ocean floor. A geologist said it would be easy to understand that Zealandia is a continent, \"if you could pull the plug on the world's oceans\" and let the water out. It may take time for scientists to agree there are eight continents.", "Engineers from the University of Colorado Boulder have made a super-thin material that could help keep buildings cool. The engineers developed the amazing new material, that can cool objects even under direct sunlight. The material does not need energy to work. It does not need water to help keep things cool. The new material could do the work of air conditioners, which need a lot of energy and water. The material is not like anything found in nature. It is a glass-polymer hybrid and is just 50 micrometers thick - about the same as the aluminium foil we use for cooking.The engineers explained how the new material works. When it is put on top of something, two things happen. The first is it cools the object underneath by reflecting the sun's rays. At the same time, the second thing happens - the material takes away heat from the object underneath. An engineer said: \"The key advantage of this technology is that it works 24/7 with no electricity or water\u2026.We're excited about the opportunity to explore potential uses in the power industry, aerospace, agriculture and more.\" Just 10 to 20 square meters of this material could cool down a house in summer.", "Kenya's High Court has stopped the government from closing the world's largest refugee camp. The Dadaab camp has 330,000 refugees. Kenya's government wanted to close it and send 260,000 Somali refugees back to Somalia. The High Court decided this was wrong. A judge said the government could not target only Somali refugees. He said it was discrimination. Kenya's government said it wanted to close the camp because of security worries. It said terrorist attacks in Kenya by a Somalia-based group were planned in the camp.Dadaab was set up in 1992 to help people escaping from Somalia's civil war. It is run by the United Nations. When Kenya's government said it would close the camp, human rights groups became worried. They feared that sending back so many refugees to Somalia would create another humanitarian crisis. The group Amnesty International welcomed the court's decision. It said: \"Today is a historic day for more than a quarter of a million refugees who were at risk of being forcefully returned to Somalia, where they would have been at serious risk of human rights abuses.\"", "Models must get down to an unhealthy weight to keep their bosses happy. A new study says modeling agencies pressure models to be a size zero. If the model is not skinny enough, she will not get jobs. The study is the largest ever to look at eating disorders among professional models. Lead researcher Dr Rachel Roberts said it was the first study to look into the link between unhealthy eating and pressure from modeling agencies. She said: \"We now have\u2026 scientific proof that eating disorders are a serious health problem in the modeling industry.\"Researchers questioned female models and found that 81% of them were underweight. Many led an unhealthy lifestyle to stay skinny so their agencies would give them work. They missed meals, didn't eat for days, used diet pills and made themselves throw up. Over half said their agency would not give them jobs unless they lost more weight. Agencies are not breaking the law, but eating disorders can lead to serious health problems. These include infertility, heart damage, weak bones, organ failure and even death. Teenagers want bodies like the models, which leads to more health issues.", "The CEO of Starbucks has said his company would employ 10,000 refugees over the next five years. The CEO of the international coffee shop chain is unhappy with President Donald Trump's ban on people from seven Middle Eastern and North African countries. The CEO said he promised to make a big effort to welcome people escaping from war, violence and discrimination. He added: \"There are more than 65 million\u2026refugees, and we are developing plans to hire 10,000 of them over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks does business.\"Many people are angry with Starbucks. Trump supporters called for a boycott of Starbucks coffee shops. They want Starbucks to help the 40,000 unemployed war veterans in the USA instead of refugees. Starbucks has already hired 8,800 veterans since 2013. Mr Trump's supporters asked consumers to stop doing business with companies who are negative about the President, like Amazon. Opponents of Mr. Trump have started the hashtag #GrabYourWallet to get consumers to avoid doing business with companies that have supported Mr Trump or have business links to him.", "Scientists from the BPA have said the world has become more dangerous in the past year. BPA scientists are experts on nuclear weapons, energy, climate change, and new technologies. They set the Doomsday Clock, which was started in 1947 to show how close the world is to disaster. The BPA just moved the clock's minute hand from three minutes to midnight to two-and-a-half minutes to midnight. This is the closest it has been to midnight (the Apocalypse) since 1953. Then, the minute hand was at two minutes to midnight after hydrogen bomb tests by the USA and Russia.The BPA's report said President Donald Trump's statements on climate change, nuclear weapons, immigration and terrorism have added to global risk. The BPA warned that: \"The probability of global catastrophe is very high, and the actions needed to reduce the risks of disaster must be taken very soon.\" The BPA chief asked people to make sure their leaders do the right things. She said: \"I hope the debate [created] by the 2017 setting of the Clock\u2026helps citizens around the world hold their leaders responsible for delivering a safer and healthier planet.\"", "There may be pieces of plastic in seafood. They are called microplastics. These are tiny pieces of plastic from the garbage that is in oceans. They are less than a millimeter wide. They are becoming more common in seafood such as oysters and other kinds of shellfish. Scientists say there are more than five trillion pieces of microplastic in our oceans. More are being added every day. Professor Richard Thompson, a marine biologist, said: \"Hundreds of marine organisms [mix with] plastic\u2026in the water\u2026and many of those encounters are harmful if not fatal.\"Researchers in Belgium conducted a study into microplastics. They believe people eat up to 11,000 pieces of plastic each year. Only around 60 of these pieces stay in our body - the rest disappear down the toilet. Sixty pieces of microplastic is not a lot but it will build up over time. They could eventually be bad for our health. Things will get worse. By the end of this century, seafood eaters could eat as many as 780,000 pieces of plastic a year. That is likely to cause many health problems. Scientists say we need to recycle more and use other things instead of plastic.", "The world's eight richest men are as rich as half the world. The charity Oxfam said the billionaires have as much money as the 3.6 billion poorest people. Six of the men are from the USA. The richest is Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who is worth $75 billion. The founders of Amazon and Facebook are both worth around $45 billion. The report is called 'An Economy for the 99 Per Cent'. Oxfam said: \"It shows that the gap between rich and poor is far greater than had been feared.\" It added that the \"super-rich\" create income inequality by avoiding tax.Oxfam said it was shocking for so few people to have so much wealth. One in 10 people survive on less than $2 a day.  Inequality traps hundreds of millions in poverty. Oxfam added that: \"Across the world, people are being left behind. Their wages are [not going up] yet corporate bosses take home million-dollar bonuses.\" It said governments only care about big business and a \"wealthy elite\". An economist said the report was unfair because Oxfam was attacking rich people. He said Oxfam should focus on ways to increase growth instead of complaining about the rich.", "Researchers in Sweden have unlocked one of nature's biggest secrets. They worked out how spiders make such strong silk for their spider webs. The spider's silk is very strong. It is tougher than steel. For decades, scientists looked into what makes spider silk so amazing. Finally, researchers in Sweden have found the answer. They found that a spider's silk gland has a special acid level. This helps to make the silk very strong. The researchers copied this process and made enough artificial spider-web silk to stretch for one kilometer.The new artificial silk could be very useful. Doctors are interested in it for stitches. They also think it can help the skin after a burn and replace torn ligaments in the body. Airplane companies and makers of protective clothes also see many uses for the new silk. A researcher spoke about how important the discovery could be. She said: \"This is the first successful example of [copying] spider silk spinning\u2026.This may allow industrial production of artificial silk for bio-material applications or\u2026advanced textiles.\" The silk could be an important new material for us in the future.", "We all know zombies are only in horror movies. Or do we? An article in a University of Leicester physics journal predicts that zombies could kill most people on Earth in just 100 days. Students predicted there would only be 273 survivors of a zombie apocalypse. The students were not using real zombies. Instead, they pretended a deadly virus had infected someone and spread around the world. One person with the virus would have a 90 per cent chance of giving it to another person every day. At that rate, the human population would fall to just 273 people by day 100.A professor at the university explained why students did research using zombies, even though they do not exist. He said: \"Every year we ask students to write short papers for the 'Journal of Physics Special Topics'. It lets the students show off their creative side and apply some of the physics they know.\" He also said it gives students practice in writing and checking academic papers. He added that it tested the ability of students to use their understanding of physics to imaginary situations. This could help in the future to prepare us for real-life disasters.", "Research says language barriers are holding back science around the world. English is the language of science, but one-third of research is not published in English. This means researchers do not see a lot of important research. Researchers from the University of Cambridge said important science is being missed at an international level. They said journals should have basic summaries of a study's key findings in many languages. They also said universities should translate their research into different languages, especially Chinese, French, Portuguese and Spanish.International companies are now asking their staff to communicate only in English. They want to reduce language barriers. Germany's Volkswagen just announced that English is its official language. It hopes the switch to English will attract employees. Japan's carmaker Honda also announced its staff must use English by 2020. Researcher Tatsuya Amano said scientists needed \"to start seriously tackling this issue.\" He gave an example of important research about avian flu in China going unnoticed by the World Health Organization because it was published in journals in Chinese.", "Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Japan's surprise attack on the base in 1941 led to the USA joining World War II. Mr Abe did not apologize for the attack. He said: \"The people of the USA and the people around the world, as the Prime Minister of Japan, I offer my sincere and everlasting condolences to the souls of those who lost their lives here.\" Mr Abe also said: \"We must never repeat the horrors of war again. This is the serious vow the people of Japan have taken.\" President Obama welcomed Mr Abe, \"in the spirit of friendship\".A total of 353 Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor, killing 2,403 US personnel. The attack also damaged or destroyed 19 US warships. Mr Abe is the first Japanese leader for decades to visit Pearl Harbor and the first to visit a special memorial there. He spoke about the US role in rebuilding Japan after WWII. He said after the war, \"Japan was a nation in burnt-out ruins as far as the eye could see, suffering miserable poverty\" and the USA sent food to eat and clothes to wear. He added that the friendship between the USA and Japan was an \"alliance of hope\".", "A new study shows that female doctors are better than male doctors, but get less pay. Researchers looked at over three million medical records for hospitalizations and for readmissions (people who had to stay in hospital a second time). The percentages of readmissions and mortality (deaths) were lower if the doctor was female. Mortality rates were 15.02 per cent and readmission rates were 11.07 per cent for female doctors, compared with 15.57 per cent mortality and 11.49 per cent readmission rates for patients of male doctors.The researchers did not say why women gave better care to patients than men. Researcher Dr. Ashish Jha said many lives could be saved in the USA every year if male doctors did as well as female doctors. He said: \"We estimate that approximately 32,000 fewer patients would die if male physicians [got] the same [results] as female physicians.\" He also said it was wrong that men got paid more than women, because women were better at their jobs. Dr Jha added, \"We need to understand why these differences exist\u2026and figure out how to translate it\" to cover all doctors.", "For the first time, scientists know the secrets to one of the world's most recognizable but least understood fish \u2013 the seahorse. Researchers worked out the genome of the tiger tail seahorse. A genome is a map of all the genes and genetic information in a living thing. Scientists can now find out a lot more about seahorses. They can find out why seahorses are so different to other fish. Seahorses have no teeth. Male seahorses carry babies and give birth to them instead of females. Also, seahorses do not swim horizontally like other fish; they swim vertically (up and down).Seahorses started to change about 100 million years ago. They began to not look like other fish and get their unusual shape. They began to look like the neck and head of a horse. There are 54 different types of seahorse. The scientific name for a seahorse is Hippocampus. This word comes from the Ancient Greek words hippos, which means 'horse' and kampos, which means 'sea monster'. Perhaps we should call them seahorse monsters. The word 'seahorse' can also be written as two separate words (sea horse), or with a dash (sea-horse).", "Venezuela's government has taken nearly 4 million children's toys from a toy company. It will give the toys to children for free or at low prices. The government says the company unfairly charged high prices for the toys so only rich people could buy them. Venezuela has one of the highest rates of inflation in the world. The rate could be as high as 2,000 per cent in 2017. Many Venezuelans can't afford non-essential items like toys. Even a jar of Nutella can cost half the monthly minimum salary. In the past few months, Venezuela has also cut the price of clothes.The government seized 3,821,926 toys. It tweeted: \"Our children are sacred\u2026.Boys and girls of this country will have a happy Christmas.\" The government said the toy company kept the toys out of the shops to reduce their supply and increase prices. The government also said it bought the toys with dollars it got at very low rates and tried to sell them at much higher prices. The company said it has done nothing wrong and was not trying to sell the toys at high prices to make big profits. It said many of the toys were out of fashion.", "A father in Mexico was surprised when he put an invitation to his daughter Rubi's 15th birthday party on Facebook. He thought it was for his family, friends and neighbours, but the post went viral. Over 1.2 million people accepted his invitation.

The Sioux people have lived on the land for thousands of years. The Sioux are Native Americans. They have been joined by many protestors. They are all trying to stop the $3.8 billion pipeline. They say it will dirty their drinking water. They also say the pipeline will damage sacred Sioux sites. A company from Texas, Energy Transfer Partners, owns the 1,885-km pipeline project. It is almost complete.The protestors call themselves \"water protectors\". They have been trying to block the pipeline for months. They were recently joined by U.S. military veterans (retired soldiers, sailors and members of the air force). The veterans built the protestors shelters to keep warm in the freezing winter. There has been violence between the protestors and police. A North Dakota spokesman said some of the protestors were \"frightening\".

Researchers from Duke University in the USA looked at the behaviour and health of 45 female monkeys. The monkeys with a lower social status had more health problems. The monkeys were split into five groups. The researchers gave the monkeys time to get to know each other. Then they took one monkey from each group and put her into another group. This meant she was the \"new girl\" at the bottom of the group. Researchers found that the \"new girl\" was unhealthier than the other monkeys.The researchers said that although their study focused on monkeys, the findings could also be true for humans because we share a lot of our DNA with monkeys. Professor Graham Rook, from University College London, told the BBC News that governments need to understand that people with a lower social status have more health problems. He said \"people at the bottom\" have got cars and TVs, but that does not mean they are happy. If they feel they are at the bottom, their health will get worse. People who are richer can live up to two decades longer than those who are poorer.", "The USA put the world's most powerful weather satellite into space. Scientists say it will greatly change how we predict the weather and look at weather events. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said its $1 billion satellite, called GOES-R, will take weather photographs five times faster than other satellites, with four times higher image quality. The NOAA said: \"Without a doubt, GOES-R will revolutionize weather forecasting.\" A weather forecaster said the difference in the quality of the satellite's images is like the difference between black and white TVs and HD TVs.The new satellite will give us powerful, real-time images. These will make the world safer. Airline pilots will get better data to stay away from turbulence. The satellite will zoom in on severe weather events to get much more detailed pictures. This will help emergency services to warn people more quickly and reduce the loss of human life and property. People will have better information about hurricanes, flooding, ash clouds, wildfires, and more. The NOAA said: \"It will give the weather as it's looking now rather than the weather that happened 15 to 30 minutes ago.\"", "Biologists have thought of a new way to increase the size of crops by 20 per cent. They genetically modified the thing in plants that is responsible for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the important chemical reaction where plants use sunlight to change carbon dioxide into oxygen. It lets us breathe. The scientists found a way for plants to use the energy they get from sunlight better, so they produce more food. Lead researcher Professor Stephen Long said his team is genetically modifying the world's biggest crops, such as rice, wheat, maize and soybean.The scientists changed the thing that plants use to protect themselves from damage from the Sun's strongest rays. Plants turn their energy into heat when they become too hot. However, plants do this even when clouds block the Sun. The scientists put extra copies of the heat-loss genes into plants. These speed up the heat-loss process so the plants can quickly return to using energy to grow. This could help the world's food needs. Professor Long said if he could get 20 per cent more food from crops, it would reduce the future pressure on food supply.", "Israel has OK'd a bill to make mosques quieter. If the bill becomes law, Israel's mosques will not be able to use loudspeakers during the call to prayer. The call to prayer happens five times a day. The first time is at dawn and the last is after sunset. The bill has to pass several more stages to become law. It says loudspeakers at mosques are too loud and damage the quality of life for people who live near mosques. The Israeli politician who made the bill said, \"hundreds of thousands of Israelis suffer regularly and daily from noise caused by the [prayer] calls from mosques\".Israel's Prime Minister supports the bill. He said: \"Israel is committed to freedom of religion, but it must also protect citizens from the noise of the announcements.\" An Arab politician said the bill was, \"another law in a series of racist\u2026laws that only aim to create an atmosphere of hatred\u2026against the Arab public\". Another critic said the bill would,  \"create noise that will hurt all of society and the efforts to establish [harmony] between Jews and Arabs\".

DST is the semi-annual practice of putting clocks backwards an hour in the autumn and forwards an hour in the spring. It is to have an extra hour of evening daylight over the summer months. Scientists are questioning the value of changing the time. They say it could be harmful to our health and increase energy costs. The states of California and Massachusetts in the USA are considering ending DST. Lawmakers there say it has no meaning today because we have electric lights and people work around the clock.People who support DST say it saves energy because lights are turned on later. They argue people do more outdoor activities, so it is good for physical and psychological health. They also say it cuts traffic accidents and crime. People who support DST include city workers, shop owners, people who do outdoor sports, and tourism companies. People who want DST to end say it increases energy costs and causes health risks. The number of heart attacks and strokes can increase because of changes to our body clock. With less rest, people make more mistakes, so accidents increase.", "The UAE has introduced a law to get people to read more. The law includes many measures to achieve a higher literacy rate. Government workers will have time during working hours to read books. Private companies will have to create libraries at their offices, factories and other workplaces. It will also encourage shopping centres to offer spaces for public libraries. These libraries will be easy to use for people with reading disabilities. Even cafes will have to offer books and other reading materials to their customers.The UAE's National Reading Law is the idea of President Sheikh Khalifa. The UAE has a National Strategy for Reading. This is a 10-year goal to create a country of \"avid readers\" and make reading a lifelong habit for adults and students. It also aims to get students to read an average of 20 or more books a year.

Researchers from a research organisation were shocked by their findings. Matthew Smith, a data analyst, said: \"You probably wouldn't expect that three in every four people you see are [hiding] a criminal past. Yet that's exactly what is happening\u2026.As many as 74 per cent of British people are 'micro-criminals' \u2013 having [done] at least one very minor or 'micro' crime.\" The most common crime the British public say they have done is paying someone cash when they know that the person will not pay tax on it.The researchers say men and middle-class people were the most likely to commit micro crimes. About 80 per cent of middle-class people admitted to micro crimes, while the figure was closer to 70 per cent for working-class people. The second-most common micro crime was illegally downloading or streaming TV shows, movies or music. Slightly fewer than 30 per cent of people said they did this. Other micro crimes include not paying for bags in supermarkets, lying about your age to get a better deal, and eating things in a supermarket without paying.", "The Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte has announced his country will move away from the USA and work with China.

The scientists are from the International Potato Center. They won the prize for making sweet potatoes healthier. This has benefits for millions of people around the world. The scientists developed sweet potatoes that have extra amounts of Vitamin A. This means they contain more nutrition. One researcher said it was difficult to get farmers to help him with his work. The researcher said: \"They told me it was a bad idea.\" The farmers said their job was to grow more potatoes, kill pests and reduce poverty, not increase nutrition.The sweet potato could stop people dying from malnutrition. This is not having enough to eat. A lack of Vitamin A is very harmful. Scientists say malnutrition affects over 140 million small children in 118 countries. It also affects over seven million pregnant women. Scientists also say it is a big reason for children becoming blind. Jan Low, from the International Potato Center, said the prize-winning sweet potatoes could make a big difference. Hungry people could get enough Vitamin A. She hopes more scientists will grow vegetables that have extra nutrition.", "Scientists from NASA want to get humans to Mars. Researchers are currently trying to find out what plants can grow in the soil on Mars. They hope that astronauts will grow their own food on the Red Planet. The journey to Mars could take two-and-a-half years. The astronauts will need to take a lot of food with them to last for the journey. They will never be able to come back to Earth. This means they will need to grow their own fruit, vegetables, etc. from seeds. NASA said there could be a problem because Mars doesn't have soil that is good for growing things. It just has red dust.Humans could be on Mars in the next 15 years. NASA has been testing \"Martian gardens\" to see what might grow on Mars. They used a soil made of crushed volcanic rock. It contains no nutrients or organic material, so it is similar to the dust on Mars. The scientists grew lettuce in it. The lettuce tasted normal, but it had weaker roots and took longer to grow.

The United Nations (UN) agency UNESCO made a promise that every child in the world would get a primary and secondary education in the next 14 years. UNESCO says a lot of work needs to be done to find those teachers. The biggest numbers are needed in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. At the moment, UNESCO says there are \"massive shortages\" of teachers. There are currently 263 million children who do not go to school. Around 25 million of these might never go.The UN warns there are shortages of teachers in countries with rising populations. This makes it harder to find enough teachers as there are more children. The UN says that without \"urgent action\" things will get worse. UNESCO is also worried about the quality of teachers. In countries like Ghana, Liberia and Sierra Leone, fewer than 60 per cent of primary school teachers are trained. There are also worries about class sizes.

They have argued for many years over borders in Kashmir. India could also limit the amount of water Pakistan gets from the Indus River. The latest disagreement is over movies and actors. Pakistan's major cinemas have banned Indian movies in its biggest cities. Cinema owners say the ban is to support Pakistani soldiers who are risking their lives in Kashmir. The ban comes after Indian moviemakers banned Pakistani actors from working in India's famous Bollywood movie studios in Mumbai.Bollywood movies are very popular in Pakistan. The cinema industry will lose a lot of money because people will stay at home. A lot of Pakistan's cinema business comes from Bollywood. Pakistani actors may also lose money. They will make less money in Pakistan's movie industry than in Bollywood. However, Pakistani actors said it was time for Pakistani actors to stop working in Bollywood.

An allergy to peanuts can be deadly. Researchers from a London university say that feeding eggs and peanuts to babies may stop them getting allergies when they are older. The researchers looked at studies of more than 200,000 children to see when they first ate eggs and peanuts. They found that if 4-6-month-old babies ate eggs, they were 40 per cent less likely to get an egg allergy than children who ate eggs later. Babies aged four-to-11 months old who ate peanut products were 70 per cent less likely to get an allergy to peanuts.Egg and peanut allergies are the two most common childhood food allergies. Parents must be careful when feeding babies eggs and nuts. Babies should never have whole nuts because they might choke. They should only eat smooth and not crunchy peanut butter. Other food allergies are to soy, wheat, sesame, fish and seafood. Giving these foods to babies one at a time may protect them from allergies. Parents should check their baby's health after each new food. The researchers say that more research is needed to find the best ages to start feeding eggs and peanuts to babies.", "A survey shows that people who use the Internet too much may have mental health problems. People who are addicted to the Internet have problems if they cannot get online regularly. The survey from McMaster University in Canada looked at the Internet habits of 254 students. It also looked at the students' mental health. The researchers said 107 students were addicted or had problems because of their Internet use. These included depression and anxiety. A professor said we know little about the dangers of Internet addiction and need to do more research.Researcher Michael Van Ameringen explained what problems he found with students. He said: \"We found that [students addicted to the Internet] had significantly more trouble dealing with their day-to-day activities, including life at home, at work or school.\"  He added: \"[People] with Internet addiction also had significantly higher amounts of depression and anxiety symptoms, problems with planning and [problems with] time management.\" We need to find out how big a problem Internet addiction is. We also need to find out if mental health problems cause Internet addiction.", "Humans may not be the only ones to use language to communicate. Scientists think dolphins also use words and sentences to speak to each other. We know that dolphins can communicate. New research suggests that this communication is similar to our conversations. Scientists say the sounds that dolphins make look like sentences. These let dolphins send messages to each other. The dolphins use their language to identify themselves, have relations, and do things together. Scientists say that we may be able to understand dolphin language and talk to dolphins in the future.Researchers in Crimea discovered that dolphins had their own language after they recorded two bottlenose dolphins. The scientists noticed that the dolphins listened to each other and then replied. Researcher Dr Vyacheslav Ryabov said: \"This\u2026resembles a conversation between two people.\" He added: \"This language exhibits all the\u2026features present in the human spoken language. This indicates a high level of intelligence and consciousness in dolphins.\" Dr Ryabov said the dolphins' language is, \"a highly developed spoken language, like the human language.\"", "Facebook has decided not to block a famous photograph of the Vietnam War. The photo is of a naked, 9-year-old Vietnamese girl and other terrified children running away from a napalm attack. She has a badly burnt back. The iconic photo was taken by photographer Nick Ut, who won a Pulitzer Prize for photo-journalism. Facebook banned the photo because the child is naked. Facebook got a lot of complaints. Norway's president Erna Solberg said the photo was an important part of history and that Facebook was editing history by banning it.Ms Solberg explained her anger. She said: \"They must see the difference between editing out child pornography and editing out history.\" She wrote on her own Facebook page: \"I want my children and other children to grow up in a society where history is taught as it was.\" Facebook said: \"An image of a naked child would normally\u2026violate our community standards, and in some countries might even qualify as child pornography.\" It added: \"In this case, we recognize the history and global importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time.\"", "What is school for? It's an easy question, but a poll in the USA shows people have different opinions on school. The poll is called the 'Public\u2019s Attitudes Toward the Public Schools'. It is from a worldwide group of teachers called PDK International. PDK asked Americans to name the biggest purpose of school. Just 45 per cent of people said the main goal was to prepare students to pass exams. Around a quarter of people said it was to get kids ready to find a job. Just over 26 per cent of Americans said the biggest reason for school was to teach children about citizenship. Joshua Starr, CEO of PDK, said the poll questioned whether schools were doing the right thing and if they were, \"what the public wants\". He quoted from author James Baldwin, who said in 1963 that the purpose of school is \"to ask questions of the universe and learn to live with those questions.\" Students had different ideas about school. Elena Brankov, 15, said it was to teach children to be creative, to share ideas and to use technology to make the world a better place. Lyndon Bailey, also 15, said school, \"is just to make poor kids into robots who work and make rich people richer\".", "Colombians are happy that peace has come to Colombia. The government signed a deal with the rebel group FARC. It ends 52 years of fighting. Over 220,000 people died and millions lost their home. The deal comes after two years of talks between the two sides. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said the deal was, \"the beginning of the end to the suffering, pain and tragedy of war\". A spokesman for the government said: \"This agreement opens the door to a more inclusive society.\" Both sides will now work together for justice for the victims of the fighting.FARC is the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. It started during the Cold War to fight for farmers. It will now take part in the political process to shape Colombia's future. In Bogota, the capital city, thousands of people celebrated the peace deal on the streets. One Colombian told the Associated Press news agency: \"I can die in peace because finally I'll see my country without violence, with a future for my children.\" The next step is for the Colombian people to vote on the peace deal on the 2nd of October. President Santos said: \"It will be the most important election of our lives.\"", "We have a better idea of what people wore 5,000 years ago. Scientists studied the material that was on the body of a man who died in Europe 5,300 years ago. His body was frozen under ice. Archaeologists found him in a glacier in 1991. They called him Otzi the Iceman. They also found Otzi's accessories and weapons. Scientists studied everything they found to get an idea of how early humans looked, their food and their clothes. They even have an idea of what Otzi sounded like. Otzi also provided \"rare and valuable information\" about how humans used animals.Otzi's clothes were from several different animals. His leggings were made from goat leather. He wore a hat made from bear fur. His leather coat was from at least four different kinds of animals. His shoes were made from grass. Otzi's body was covered in 61 tattoos. Scientists say these were to make pain go away and not for beauty. Otzi was 45 when he died. This was old for a man 5,000 years ago. He had problems with his heart and with his teeth. Scientists say he did not die naturally. He was murdered. Someone killed him with an arrow, which hit him in the head.", "Humans have learnt many things from nature that help us in our daily life. The latest thing is self-repairing clothing. Scientists have developed a way for cotton, linen and wool clothes to repair themselves, without the need for sewing. Scientists from the Naval Research Office and Pennsylvania State University in the USA looked at how squid can cling on to things so well. They found a protein in the teeth that cover the suckers on a squid. The protein is like the one found in the silk that spiders use to make spider webs. It is very strong and stretchy.The new protein is now part of a coating, which is put on clothes. A rip or tear in clothes joins together in less than a minute after it is dipped in water. This could be useful for military and survival clothes. People will be safer with clothes that repair quickly and easily. A scientist spoke about the invention. He said: \"The coatings are thin, less than a micron, so they wouldn't be noticed in everyday wear.\" He added: \"Even thin, they increase the overall strength of the material. For the first time, we are making self-healing textiles.\"", "Research from Yale University shows that people who read live longer. Reading for 30 minutes a day could help us. Researchers said reading keeps the mind active, reduces stress and makes us take better care of our health. The researchers said books help the brain more than newspapers and magazines, but any kind of reading is good. In the study, researchers looked at the lifestyles, reading habits, health and education of 3,500 men and women over a 12-year period. All of the people were at least 50 years old at the start of the research.The study is in a journal. It found that people who read for up to 3.5 hours a week were 17 per cent less likely to die than those who read no books. Those who read for over 3.5 hours a week were 23 per cent less likely to die. A researcher said: \"Older individuals, regardless of gender, health, wealth or education, showed the survival advantage of reading books.\" She added: \"Individuals over the age of 65 spend an average of 4.4 hours per day watching television. Efforts to redirect leisure time into reading books could prove to be beneficial.\"", "Economists from the banking company Goldman Sachs have taken a break from looking at the world's economy. They have put their heads together to predict how many medals different countries will win at the 2016 Rio Olympics. There are no real surprises. Most people know that the USA and China will win the most medals. A small surprise is the economists predicted Great Britain will finish third. They predicted 23 gold medals for Team GB and 59 medals in total. They also think the world's second most populous country, India, will win just one gold medal.There is good news for the host Brazil. The country that hosts the Olympics usually gets 50 per cent extra golds. Goldman Sachs predicts that Brazil will win 22 medals, including five golds. This would be Brazil's best ever Olympics performance. The economists also predicted the Olympics will benefit Brazil's economy. They said: \"As the country welcomes thousands of athletes and visitors and cheers the local favorites, it silently hopes that the soaring Olympic spirit will also help lift the spirits of the Brazilian economy.\" The 2016 Rio Olympics is sure to be one of the best ever.", "Researchers say office workers and other people who sit down a lot must exercise for one hour a day. This is to increase their chance of living longer. Doctors keep telling us that sitting down all day will make our life shorter. Researchers say that sitting in a chair all day is as dangerous as smoking or being overweight. Sitting for eight hours a day could increase the risk of dying early by up to 60 per cent. However, there is good news for people who sit at a desk all day. One hour's exercise each day can cancel the risk of an early death from sitting all day.The research was published in time for the Olympic Games. Researchers hope this will get people to exercise more. Being inactive increases the risk of getting heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Watching TV all day is one of the worst things we can do. This is also because we will also eat unhealthy snacks. Office workers should get out of their seat more often. A researcher advised people to: \"Take a five-minute break every hour, go to the next office, go upstairs to the coffee machine, go to the printer.\" He added: \"Build physical activity into your everyday life.\"", "A photo of Britain's three-year-old Prince George has made animal rights groups angry. The photo was to celebrate the young prince's third birthday. It shows him offering white chocolate ice cream to his pet dog. An animal charity warned all pet owners about giving ice cream and chocolate to pets. The charity is the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). It said Prince George was trying to be kind to his dog, but it wasn't a good thing to do because chocolate and ice cream are bad for dogs. The RSPCA said it did not advise others to do the same as Prince George.Some people have defended the photo and said Prince George was not wrong. They said a three-year-old does not know what is dangerous for dogs. He was playing and being kind to his pet. They also said the dog was not eating the ice cream in the photo. The RSPCA said: \"It is lovely that Prince George is trying to help keep his family dog cool\". It added: \"We would advise pet owners to be [careful] when giving their dogs food meant for [humans] as some items, like chocolate, can be highly toxic to dogs.\" Chocolate poisons dogs, and can kill them.", "An employee of Donald Trump admitted plagiarism in helping to write a speech for Melania Trump. Mrs Trump was speaking at a convention to support her husband Donald. He is the Republican nominee in the race to be the next President of the USA. Mrs Trump made a speech about how great she thought her husband was. Many journalists recognised several lines from the speech. They were the same as lines in a speech given by Michelle Obama about her husband Barack. Newspapers have been full of stories about how Mrs Trump could make a speech that was plagiarised.Plagiarism is copying the work of other people without saying you are copying it. Students are taught that copying is stealing. Students who copy usually get an F-grade for their work. Schools often expel students for plagiarism. A university examination expert said: \"Melania's speech offers us a [clear] example of plagiarism in action, from the highest levels of American politics.\" A writing expert said people will not trust or believe Melania Trump from now. Donald Trump said the speech was \"good news\" because it, \"got more publicity than any [speech] in the history of politics\".", "Researchers say children should be doing more learning outdoors. The researchers say children spend too much time sitting in classrooms to pass exams. They say outdoor learning is important for social skills, health and development. It also increases their quality of life. There have been five important reports that stress the need for students to learn outdoors and experience nature. The researchers say that schools are not taking the advice of these reports. Outdoor learning is on the decline. The researchers want to put outdoor learning on the curriculum of all schools.The researchers say there are many benefits of outdoor learning for children. One advantage is that it builds confidence in children. They experience things that were normal for their parents, like climbing trees. It also makes children more aware of the environment and teaches them to respect nature. There are also health benefits. Children exercise more instead of sitting in classrooms or being at home with video games. Another benefit is that it helps with the problem of 'stranger danger'.

", "Toyota is shutting down two elevators at its headquarters to save money. The world's largest carmaker said it will shut down two of eight elevators at its main Tokyo office. This is to save electricity and to cut down on the costs of being in the building. One reason for doing this is the strengthening Japanese yen since the UK voted in June to leave the EU. One dollar was 120 yen in January; now it is just above 100. A stronger yen means Toyota cars are more expensive and profits go down. Toyota's profit for the year ending March 2016 was a record $23 billion.Toyota said it decided to shut down the elevators several weeks ago because of the rising yen. It is also changing the temperature of air conditioners to save money. Toyota took similar cost-cutting measures after the financial crisis of 2008. That also made the yen stronger against the dollar. Toyota said: \"These policies are not new\u2026.The key objective for the stoppage of elevators\u2026is to raise awareness amongst employees, and to remind them of the commitment that Toyota has towards the idea of increasing competitiveness through\u2026reducing waste.\"", "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has advised its citizens not to wear traditional clothes when they travel overseas.

The company vice president said: \"Budweiser has always [tried hard] to embody America in a bottle, and we're honoured to salute this great nation, where our beer has been passionately brewed for the past 140 years.\"", "The Russian gun maker Kalashnikov will move into fashion. Kalashnikov is one of Russia's most famous companies. It makes the AK-47 rifle. The company said it has to make different things because Western countries stopped buying Russian weapons. This was because of the conflict in Ukraine. Before the conflict, Kalashnikov sold a lot of weapons to Europe and the USA. Kalashnikov's fashion label will make 'military style' casual clothing and accessories. The company also plans to open 60 clothes stores across Russia by the end of this year.Kalashnikov is not the first Russian arms company to sell clothes. A tank maker opened a shop in 2014 selling T-shirts, jackets, shoes and bags. Most of its products have images of its tanks on them. The Kalashnikov CEO said his company would still make most of its money from making guns. He said it would develop new products. He also wants to double the sales of guns by 2017. He added that the company would start making at least 10 new products. A marketing manager said Kalashnikov's fashions could sell well because people wanted to support Russia.", "Football fans in an English city are celebrating a fairytale win for their club. Leicester City won England's Premier League for the first time in their 132-year history. They team beat the big teams like Manchester United and Chelsea to the title. Journalists are saying it is the greatest achievement in the history of sport. Leicester were bottom of the 20-team Premier League last year. However, their style of play totally changed this year. New players and a new coach made them almost unbeatable. They won the title on Monday night and their supporters around the world went crazy.Leicester were promoted to the Premier League only two years ago. They were favourites to go back down again this season. No one gave them a chance of winning the League. Last August, they were 5,000-1 against winning the title. If you had put a $1 bet on them to win, you could now collect $5,000. The actor Tom Hanks said he bet $100 on Leicester and will now get $500,000 back. Leicester's team cost less to buy than just one star in the top teams. However, two Leicester players won awards in England. It is also likely that Leicester's manager Claudio Ranieri will be world coach of the year.", "A group headed by Elon Musk has opened a kind of gym for robots, called OpenAI Gym. Mr Musk is the boss of the electric car company Tesla Motors and the space travel company, SpaceX. He also founded the online payments website PayPal. His latest project is an open platform for code writers to test their latest work. People are free to test their ideas for artificial intelligence (A.I.) on it. Researchers can test and share their algorithms for A.I. Algorithms are special sets of rules in a computer program that can solve problems and deal with lots of information.Mr Musk wrote about why his team decided to make the OpenAI Gym free. He said: \"Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, [without the] need to generate [money].\" The OpenAI Gym follows the idea of giving rewards for learning \u2013 like giving a dog a treat when it learns something new. If an algorithm does well in the gym, it gets a reward. If it fails, it gets no reward. The aim of the gym is to develop an algorithm that can multi-task; to do many things at the same time, rather than just one thing.", "A group in Japan is worried about people with eating disorders. The Japan Society for Eating Disorders (JSED) said people who eat too much or too little receive no support. The JSED said many people are ill because of being overweight or underweight. It said few of these people get medical help. The president of JSED said: \"Hundreds of thousands of people are suffering in silence. There are very few services available to help people.\" He added: \"It's often too late by the time the patient is seen in a hospital. Their condition is very severe. Sometimes they are even close to death.\"Japan's Ministry of Health said it was difficult to find out how many people suffer from eating disorders. It said many women were too embarrassed to see a doctor and did not want to admit they had a problem. A spokesman said the government was trying to publish more information about eating disorders. He said: \"We want to set up local systems of support where their illness can be picked up early, so people can be helped sooner.\" Figures show that in 2014, only 10,000 people in Japan got treatment for eating disorders, compared to 725,000 people in the U.K.", "The rock star Prince has died at the age of 57. He passed away at his home in Minneapolis. Last week, his plane made an emergency landing to take him to hospital. He had dehydration and the flu. His death has shocked the entertainment world. Many celebrities have shared their thoughts about him online. Madonna wrote: \"He changed the world. A true visionary.\" Barack Obama called him, \"one of the most gifted and prolific musicians of our time\". He added that: \"Prince\u2026was a virtuoso instrumentalist, a brilliant bandleader, and an electrifying performer.\"Prince was the son of a jazz pianist. His real name was Prince Rogers Nelson. He became famous in the late seventies. His singing, songwriting, guitar playing, performances and producing changed the music world over four decades. The Washington Post called him, \"one of the most popular, inventive and influential recording artists of his generation\". Prince sold over 100 million records. He is perhaps best known for his 1984 album 'Purple Rain'. The music magazine 'Rolling Stone' ranked Prince at number 27 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.", "A McDonald's restaurant will soon open in the USA and will offer all-you-can-eat French fries. The new store will open in July. McDonald's says it is the restaurant \"of the future\" because of the many features it will have. In addition to the fries, the new location will have armchairs and a large play space for children. Customers will also be able to order food from the waiting staff. There will also be a kiosk where customers can personalise their orders by choosing toppings or fillings. The restaurant owner said: \"There are hundreds of different choices to build the burger of your dreams.\"The addition of all-you-can-eat fries is just one of many recent changes at McDonald's. The new McDonald's boss has been trying many new things to make more profit. Some of the changes include an all-day breakfast menu, touch-screen ordering and taking things off the menu. People have different views about McDonald's offering the fries. Health campaigners say it will lead to a rise in obesity. They say McDonald's should have healthier food. Many of the restaurant's customers say endless fries are a great idea. One said she couldn't wait and will be going to McDonald's more often.", "A mummy that was found in Mongolia has gone viral because it seems to be wearing Adidas boots. People have tweeted that the mummy shows that time travel exists. The mummy was found in the Altai Mountains in a remote part of Mongolia. It is around 1,500 years old. The mummy\u2019s boots look like a pair of snowboarding boots made by the sports company Adidas. The boots have the same three stripes that Adidas is famous for putting on its footwear. A picture of the boots has gone viral. People are tweeting that the mummy is a modern human who travelled back in time.The mummy's grave was found in 2010 by local farmers. Last October, archaeologists started digging. They thought the site had many important things. The archaeologists found horse's saddles, clay vases, wooden bowls, and metal kettles. The site was the first complete Turkic burial ground found in Central Asia. Turkic people started living in a region between Central Asia and Siberia around 2,600 years ago. They had their own language and alphabet. The colour blue was very important in their culture. Some historians say the word 'turquoise' comes from the word 'Turkish'.", "The English pop group the Beatles told us that money can't buy us love. Many people believe that money cannot buy happiness and that it is the root of all evil. However, a new study from Cambridge University says that money can buy happiness. Researchers did a study that compared the spending habits of customers of a bank with their personality. They compared the personalities of 625 people with a list of what the people spent their money on. The conclusion of the study was that buying the right things can lead to happiness.The researchers said the study may change the way people think about money and happiness. They said: \"Spending can increase our happiness when it is spent on goods and services that fit our personalities\". Internet companies could use information about people's happiness to recommend things that increase happiness. Spending money could be more important in our lives than we thought. The researchers said: \"Spending money on products that help us express who we are could\u2026be as important to our well-being as finding the right job\u2026or even the right friends.\"", "The leader of Iceland quit on Tuesday because of a new financial scandal. Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson quit because of secret documents leaked from a Panama law firm. There are over 11.5 million leaked e-mails and letters. They contain information about how thousands of the world's richest and most powerful people avoid paying tax. The documents name over 215,000 companies and 14,153 clients of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, including many present and past world leaders. Iceland's leader is the first to resign because of the scandal.Many governments and celebrities are now trying to keep the scandal from hitting them. British leader David Cameron's father was one of the law firm's clients. Sports figures in the leaks include the new FIFA president, who is shocked that people are questioning his honesty. Mossack Fonseca could also be in trouble. Journalists say it worked with 33 people or companies that were part of international sanctions, including a cousin of Syria's president, and companies in North Korea. A tax expert said there is up to $32 trillion in untaxed financial wealth around the world.", "A technology company has made a new air cleaner for the home. The company is called Dyson. Its new air purifier is called the Pure Cool Link. The purifier captures up to 99.95 per cent of pollutants in the home. Pollutants are the things like dust, smells, chemicals, pollen and smoke. The device cleans the air in a room in an hour. It also checks the air quality to automatically keep it at safe levels. This is great for people who have allergies or for those with asthma. The device can be linked to an app so that users can control it from anywhere in the world.Pollution is a growing problem. Most of us think it is only a danger outside the home. James Dyson, the founder of the Dyson company, said: \"We think it is polluted outside of our homes, but the air inside can be far worse.\" The lead designer at Dyson explained why this can happen. He said: \"Modern homes have been built to be more sealed against noise and trap heat, which means the pollutants we create inside the home are also trapped and build up to levels up to five times more polluted indoors than out.\" The air purifiers will be on sale for between $500 and $650.", "Pope Francis is more popular than political leaders. A poll carried out by WIN/Gallup International found that 54 per cent of people around the world have a favourable opinion of the Pope. Researchers asked 1,000 people in 64 countries about who was the world's best leader. Pope Francis was most popular with Roman Catholics. Around 85 per cent of Catholics in the poll said they had a favourable opinion of him. Most of the people who did not believe in any god had a favourable opinion of the Pope. The researchers said: \"Pope Francis is a leader who transcends his own religion.\"It was predictable that Pope Francis, 79, was most popular in Catholic countries. Portugal and the Philippines were the most enthusiastic, with ratings of 94% and 93%. Francis's lowest ratings were in Algeria, Tunisia and Turkey. These were the only countries to give Francis a negative rating. Most people in Azerbaijan said they did not know much about him. The Pope beat other world leaders like Barack Obama and Angela Merkel. The BBC said Francis has, \"enormous goodwill and won the hearts and minds not just of Roman Catholics but also of people from other religions\".", "The coffee shop chain Starbucks will give customers a discount if they bring their own cups. It wants to cut down on the number of paper cups that are put in the trash. It is part of a two-month trial in cafes in England. Starbucks wants to reduce waste and recycle more. The vice president of Starbucks UK said: \"Starbucks is committed to increasing recycling rates and reusable cups are a key part of our overall waste reduction strategy.\" Bosses will decide later if they will continue the discounts. Customers who bring their own cups will not get a discount on the cafe's cheaper filter coffee.The issue of disposable paper cups has been in the news a lot. Around seven million cups are thrown away every day. Journalists said that some cafes lie about how many paper cups they recycle. The journalists say the cafes do not recycle as many cups as they say they do. Customers wrongly believe that a coffee shop is environmentally friendly. Fewer than one in 400 paper cups at coffee shop chains are recycled. A coffee drinker said she would bring her own cup. She said: \"I am disappointed that cafes recycle so little. I thought they were more responsible.\"", "Google Kenya said it would not remove a music video from YouTube. Kenya asked Google to take the video offline because it showed gay couples and images of gay Kenyan public figures. The video also shows scenes of what it is like to be gay in Kenya. It was made by a band called Art Attack. It is a remake of the song 'Same Love'. Kenya's government said the video was bad for society. It will punish anyone it catches who distributes the video. Kenya's government says homosexuality is \"unnatural\". Kenyan homosexuals can be put in prison for up to 14 years.Kenya's attempts at banning the video have made it very popular. It has been viewed over 140,000 times. The video shows images of anti-gay protests in Nairobi, and two women kissing on a bench. Kenya first tried to ban the video in February. A government spokesman said: \"We have written to Google to remove the video from their platforms. We expect they will do it within one week.\" Google replied: \"We review government removal requests when notified through the correct legal processes and in keeping with our company philosophy on\u2026freedom of expression.\"", "The technology company Apple and the FBI are having a big argument over the iPhone of a killer. In December 2015, 14 people were killed and 22 were seriously injured in a terrorist attack in California. The FBI has the iPhone of one of the terrorists and wants Apple to unlock it. The FBI thinks information in the phone can help to catch more terrorists. Apple has told the FBI that it will not open the iPhone. Apple said that would risk the security of its customers. Apple also said it would be dangerous because other people would want phones opened.The Department of Justice (DOJ) is also angry that Apple will not open the iPhone. It said Apple is using technological barriers to stop the FBI from doing its job. It said Apple must help the FBI to find out about the killer. The DOJ added that: \"Apple alone can remove those barriers so that the FBI can search the phone.\" Apple said the DOJ wanted to give Apple a bad name and make the public think that Apple was an evil company. It said: \"It seems like disagreeing with the Department of Justice means you must be evil and anti-American.\" The DOJ said it wants just one iPhone unlocked.", "Universal Studios Japan (USJ) is going to build a new theme park called Nintendoland. It will be full of rides based on Nintendo characters. A USJ spokesperson said it would be ready in 2020, in time for the Tokyo Summer Olympics. The new park will cost $351 million to build. This is nearly $100 million more than the Wizarding World of Harry Potter park at Universal Studios in Florida. Nintendo said the new park would, \"include major attractions\u2026and feature Nintendo's most famous characters and games\". It will announce more details in the future.Nintendo did not say which of its brands will be in Nintendoland. Fans predict that they will get to interact with characters like Mario, Zelda and Pokemon. Fans also hope the new rides will be for people of all ages, from young to old. Osaka resident Mika Hashimoto said she was very excited the theme park will be built. She said other characters (such as Harry Potter and Hello Kitty) had a theme park, so it was good that people could go to a Nintendo park. She added: \"It is about time fans of Nintendo had a place to go and have fun. I can't wait for Nintendoland to open.\"", "Scientists say it isn't just sad things that make us brokenhearted. Happy events can also be bad for our heart. A broken heart is a real illness. It's not just the sadness we feel when something bad happens. We get broken heart syndrome when we are stressed and during emotional times, such as a relationship breakup, the death of family and friends, or the loss of a job. The medical name for this is Takotsubo Syndrome (TTS). People can get it, and be at risk of death, when very happy things happen. The doctors who discovered this have called it \"happy heart syndrome\".The study is published in the European Heart Journal. Heart expert Dr Jelena Ghadri analysed data from 1,750 patients who suffered from TTS. The patients were from nine different countries. They found that 485 patients got TTS because of an emotional event. Twenty of these had TTS because of a happy event. The patients had heart problems after birthday parties, weddings, favourite sports teams winning, and the birth of grandchildren. Dr Ghadri said our brain may think happy and sad events are similar, so both can result in Takotsubo Syndrome.", "Scientists have found one answer to water shortages. It is a new material that collects water from the air. They got the idea from a beetle that lives in an African desert. The deserts in Namibia are very dry, but the Namib beetle is an expert at surviving in dry conditions. Its shell is covered in small bumps that collect drops of water from the air. It is enough to keep the beetle alive. Scientists studied the shape and material of the bumps. They now want to make their own materials that can collect water from the air. This will help people who live in very dry areas.The scientists say this technology could help in many areas of our life. They said it could help power plants. It could also help with heating and air conditioning. One scientist, Philseok Kim, said: \"Thermal power plants, for example, rely on [things] to quickly convert steam to liquid water. [Our] design could help speed up that process and even allow for operation at a higher temperature.\" Another scientist, Joanna Aizenberg, said she was looking forward to getting more new technologies from nature. She said: \"Everybody is excited about bio-inspired materials research.\"", "There is a doctor's job in the small New Zealand town of Tokoroa that no one wants. The job pays US$265,000 a year. There is no night work, no weekend work, and house prices in the area are low. The job is for just four days a week and has 12 weeks' annual holiday. The town's current doctor Alan Kenny is leaving. He has been looking for a replacement for two years but has had no success. Four medical companies also failed to find a replacement. Dr Kenny thinks the reason is because the job is in the countryside and everyone wants to live and work in the city.It is not only New Zealand that has problems getting doctors to live in rural areas. It is a problem in other countries too. Last year, Dr Kenny cancelled a family holiday because he could not find a doctor to replace him. Dr Kenny has been a doctor in Tokoroa for 30 years. He said he wouldn't swap his lifestyle for city life. He is 61 and wants to retire. He needs to give his patients to a younger doctor. He told a newspaper that his job keeps him busy and that he loves his work. He said: \"I would like to stay but I hit my head against a brick wall trying to attract doctors.\"", "A record number of people applied to be part of NASA's astronaut training program. NASA received over 18,300 applications for 14 jobs. This is a record. NASA's human resources officials will now spend 18 months looking at and selecting the best people.  It will announce the successful applicants in the middle of 2017. Brian Kelly of NASA said: \"It's [great] to know so many people recognize what a great opportunity this is to be part of NASA's exciting mission. I look forward to meeting the men and women talented enough to rise to the top.\"There is a great desire to work on America's space program. NASA's Charlie Bolden said: \"So many Americans from diverse backgrounds want to personally contribute to blazing the trail on our journey to Mars.\" The top applicants will have an interview in Houston, Texas. The chosen candidates will then get two years of training. They will learn things such as spacewalking, teamwork and operating spacecraft systems. They will also learn Russian. After that, they could go to the International Space Station or work for companies making spacecraft for tourists, such as SpaceX.", "A new report from Samsung describes life in 100 years from now. There are many tall skyscrapers, underwater 'bubble' cities, and holidays in space. Experts on space and architecture, and city planners gave their ideas on life in 2116. They said the way we live, work and play will be totally different from today. They said that 25 years ago, people could not imagine how the Internet would change our lives. The Internet has revolutionised the way we communicate and learn. The experts said the changes in the next century would be even more unbelievable.Researchers asked people for their predictions about the future. They predicted that people will work from home and have virtual work meetings. People will have 3D printers that will let you download a design for furniture or a food recipe and then 'print' the sofa or pizza at home. There will also be less need for doctors. Our home health capsule will tell us what the problem is and give us treatment. We will also go into space for holidays and get resources that we have used up on Earth. One prediction that was missing was whether people would need to study English.", "Scientists have seen something amazing in space for the first time. They saw gravitational waves. These are waves in space that are similar to ripples in water. They move outwards from the centre. Gravitational waves start when giant space objects hit each other. Albert Einstein first spoke about waves in space in 1916 in his General Theory of Relativity. One hundred years later, the researchers have proved Einstein was right. The researchers used powerful technology to see the waves. Einstein did not have this technology. He used his genius to predict the waves existed.The discovery of gravitational waves is one of the most important discoveries ever. A scientist from Arizona State University said it was as important as the invention of the telescope. It will let scientists see many new things in space and answer questions about our universe. The scientist said: \"It has opened a new window on the universe.\" He added that: \"Using gravitational waves to explore the universe will allow us to see things we could have never seen before.\" He said it was beautiful that the discovery happened 100 years after Einstein's prediction.", "Baby orangutans in Indonesia are going to school to learn to find food and make a nest. After they learn these skills, the young apes can return to the wild and survive on their own. The school is run by International Animal Rescue (IAR). There are 102 orangutans living at the IAR centre. A spokesperson said: \"We are committed to rescuing and rehabilitating as many orangutans as we can and giving them a second chance.\" Not all of them go to school because some are injured, so they cannot go back to the forest. It could take up to eight years to get the others ready to return to the wild.The IAR cares for animals that have been rescued. Some of the babies lost their parents because of illegal hunting, habitat loss and forest fires. The IAR said they are suffering and dying because of the destruction of the rainforest by palm oil companies. Other baby orangutans have been sold as pets. There are also adult orangutans at the centre. These have spent most of their lives in captivity. The World Wildlife Fund estimates there are up to 69,000 orangutans in Borneo. They are in danger because their forests are being destroyed by illegal logging.", "The tiny nation of Luxembourg is not well known as a player in the space race. However, its government has just invested in the asteroid mining industry. Companies will mine asteroids near the Earth for water and minerals. Some of the things they mine will help future trips to Mars and beyond. Luxembourg is looking at research and development projects to become a leader in this new industry. Its minister for the economy said: \"Our aim is to open access to a wealth of previously unexplored mineral resources on lifeless rocks\u2026without damaging natural habitats.\"Luxembourg is not the only country looking for new places to mine. In 2015, the US president signed a law to let American companies mine space resources. In January, the European Space Agency shared a vision for a base on the Moon for research and exploration. A US company said asteroid mining would allow greater exploration of space, while protecting resources on Earth. However, there could be problems. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 says that natural resources in space are part of our 'common heritage'. This means private companies may not be allowed to mine asteroids.", "The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that the Zika virus could become a global pandemic. Scientists say the outbreak could be more serious than the Ebola virus. Ebola killed over 11,000 people. The WHO estimated that the Zika virus could affect four million people this year. The virus is advancing across South and Central America. Dr Margaret Chan of the WHO warned that Zika is \"spreading explosively\". She added that it has quickly gone from being a mild to a serious threat. The mosquito that carries the virus is spreading worldwide because of warmer weather.The Zika virus is linked to a rise in birth defects in South America. Scientists say it causes a disease called microcephaly. This is where a baby is born with a smaller head, and with brain damage. In Brazil there were around 4,000 babies born with microcephaly last year. In 2014, there were just 150 cases. Colombia's government just reported that more than 2,100 pregnant women in Colombia have the virus. It is difficult to find a vaccine for the Zika virus. A doctor said a vaccine needs to be tested on pregnant women. This would be \"a practical and ethical nightmare\".", "The world's most common banana could become extinct, which is bad for banana lovers and the banana industry. A fungus called TP4 is killing millions of Cavendish banana plants. The Cavendish is the world's most common banana. The fungus blocks water tubes inside the plant, so the banana cannot get the water it needs and it dies. Scientists first discovered TP4 in Malaysia in 1990. It quickly spread to other parts of Asia, and then to Australia and Africa. TP4 is carried by the wind, water, cars and even people's boots. A tiny amount of it spreads across large areas very quickly.Before we started eating the Cavendish banana, we ate a variety called the Gros Michel. Fifty years ago, it was the world's main banana. However, a fungus called Panama Disease killed it and it became extinct in 1965. Banana growers changed to the Cavendish banana. The problem for the banana industry is that burning all their banana plants will not help the situation. This is because the fungus stays in the ground, so new plants cannot grow. Scientists say one answer is genetically modified (GM) bananas that are resistant to diseases like TP4 and Panama Disease.", "Women have to pay more than men for almost the same things. A study by The Times newspaper found that many products for women cost twice as much as similar things for men. Researchers looked at hundreds of goods in shops. They found that clothes, beauty products and toys were 36 per cent more expensive than those for men and boys. One store charged $7 more for a pink scooter than a black one. Another store charged double the price for pink razors. Researchers said women's Levi 501 jeans were 46 per cent more expensive than those for men.The Times called this \"sexist\" pricing. Other people said it was a \"gender tax\". The chairwoman of the British government's women and equalities committee called it a \"rip-off\" and an example of price discrimination. Britain's Financial Times (FT) newspaper said: \"Perhaps women tend to be busier and have less time to shop around. Or perhaps they care more about quality\u2026,whereas men just want something cheap.\" However, the FT said men did pay more for some things. It asked why journalists did not look at price differences for things that appeal more to men.", "People hate nuisance telephone calls - those from companies trying to sell us something that we do not want. They are also called 'cold calls'. Britain's government is thinking about stopping these calls. It wants to make sure the company that calls cannot hide its telephone number. With most nuisance calls, we cannot see the telephone number, but that could change. People could report companies who make nuisance calls. Britain's government is also looking at fining companies that make nuisance calls. Cold callers could get a fine of up to $720,000.Three-quarters of people with a landline in Britain get monthly cold calls. The number of people who get monthly nuisance calls on their mobiles increased by 20 per cent in the last two years. One company made 40 million cold calls in three months. Britain's minister for data protection said: \"There is no simple solution to the problem of nuisance calls, but making direct marketing companies display their telephone number will help consumers\u2026take action.\" She added: \"Being pestered by marketing calls is annoying at the best of times, and at its worst it can bring real misery for\u2026people.\"", "The United Nations says it will begin work immediately to take action against North Korea. The UN believes a nuclear test that North Korea carried out could be a hydrogen bomb. This was the fourth time that North Korea tested a nuclear bomb. It could be the first time it has tested a hydrogen bomb, which is a lot more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped during World War II. The UN said: \"A clear threat to international peace and security continues to exist.\" The UN has not said what action it would take against North Korea, nor when they would be put in place.Not all countries agree on what to do about North Korea. The USA said it does not think the test was a hydrogen bomb because the explosion was too small. Both the USA and South Korea said the test was a dangerous move by North Korea. Japan wants the UN to act quickly. It said: \"The authority and credibility of the [UN] will be put in question if it does not take these measures.\" China had strong words for North Korea. It said: \"We strongly encourage North Korea to honour its de-nuclearisation promises and to stop taking any action that will make this situation worse.\"", "The year 2016 may be one of the best years for people to keep their New Year's resolutions. These are the promises we make to ourselves at the beginning of the year to lose weight, save money, etc. About half of all adults make New Year\u2019s resolutions but fewer than 10 per cent keep them. Many people make goals at the beginning of January but give up by February. The main reason people give up is because they are too hard. People think it is easy to change their behaviour. Many resolutions need a lot of strength and many habits are difficult to change.Researchers asked people about their resolutions for 2016. The top one was to live life to the fullest. Nearly half of those who took the survey said this would be one of their goals for 2016. The second most popular resolution was to live a healthier lifestyle - 41.1% of people said this would be one of their aims. Losing weight was third on the list and wanting to spend more time with family and friends was fourth. Young people are making more resolutions than older people. Those aged 18-34 made an average of three resolutions for 2016, while older people decided on just two.", "Many diseases that had almost disappeared are making a comeback. Britain's National Health Service (NHS) reported a big rise in the number of people with diseases such as tuberculosis (TB), cholera and measles. The NHS said that TB is now more common in England than in some less developed countries. Tuberculosis is increasing across the globe. In 2013, it killed 1.5 million people worldwide, and that number is rising. It mainly affects very poor people. It is an infectious disease that affects the lungs. People suffer from bad coughs, fever and weight loss.Researchers say that many of these diseases are both preventable and treatable. A big problem in England is that TB is affecting old people who do not have enough to eat. The number of elderly who have to go without food has doubled over three years. A UK doctor said she did not understand why society didn't do more to fight TB. She said: \"Malnutrition is preventable. It is totally unacceptable that\u2026there are at least one million older people malnourished or at risk of malnourishment.\" She said there should be a bigger focus on better nutrition and proper medicine.", "There was a bomb scare on an Air France flight.

Researchers looked at how antibiotics in food are making bugs stronger. The use of antibiotics in agriculture is making bugs stronger and resistant to our medicines. The huge amount of antibiotics in farming could be dangerous to people's health. Researchers said farmers should reduce the amount of antibiotics they give to their animals. This is important if we want to make sure that our life-saving medicines still work well.The researchers want strict targets to reduce the antibiotics given to farm animals. The head of the research said: \"I find it [unbelievable] that in many countries, most of the consumption of antibiotics is in animals, rather than humans. This creates a big risk for everyone.\" He added that people could get ill from superbugs if they ate meat that was rare or undercooked. His advice is for people to make sure they cook meat properly. He said if people did not cook meat well, they should be aware of where the meat comes from.", "Research says having a pet dog helps to reduce children's stress. A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that petting a dog is a great way to help stressed kids. Researchers looked at 643 young children over an 18-month period. They found that children who have a pet dog are less stressed than children without a dog. Just twelve per cent of children with pets had signs of stress. This compares with 21 per cent of children with no dog. This will not surprise parents of children who have a dog. They know dogs are great for helping children to develop.There are many things about the research that are still unclear. Researchers do not know if less anxious children have pet dogs, or if pet dogs make children less anxious. The research just showed a link between pet dogs and children's stress. Pet dogs help children start conversations. This is often difficult for children and can cause them stress. A pet dog can be a source of comfort for children. The dog can also be a friend to a small child, who tells the pet all his or her secrets and stories. Sometimes a pet dog is so important that its name can be the first word the child speaks.", "Russia's Vladimir Putin has warned Turkey it would pay for shooting down one of its warplanes on Tuesday. Two Turkish F-16 fighter jets shot down a Russian Su-24. Turkey said the Russian jet was flying over Turkish airspace. Moscow said its plane was over Syrian airspace. Turkey warned Russia several times before about Russian planes flying over its territory. Turkey said its fighter pilots warned the Russian pilots before they fired missiles at them. The Russian pilot who survived said he received no warnings and that he was not flying over Turkey. Russia said Turkey planned the shooting.Mr Putin has advised Russians not to go to Turkey. He said Russia would cut many economic ties with Turkey. Major Russian holiday firms have removed tours to Turkey. Around 4.4 million Russians holiday in Turkey each year. Several joint projects between the two countries would also be stopped. In addition, Turkish companies trading with Russia will face more difficult trading conditions. Turkey imports most of its energy from Russia, including 60 per cent of its gas and 35 per cent of its oil. Russia also plans to build Turkey's first nuclear power station.", "France's government has said European countries must \"wake up\" to terror threats after the attacks on Paris. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told reporters that: \"It is urgent that Europe wakes up, organises itself and defends itself against the terrorist threat.\" The Paris attacks left 129 people dead and over 350 injured. Dozens of those are still in hospital in critical condition. Mr Cazeneuve said it was too easy for terrorists to move around Europe. One of the Paris attackers entered Europe through Greece. He was pretending to be a Syrian refugee.The French Ambassador Francois Richier agreed. He said: \"I believe no country in the world will tolerate this. Terrorism is an important issue. It needs to be addressed. We are currently raising this issue at the UN Security Council this week.\" More countries are joining the fight against terrorism.

It has a new service called Amazon Pantry. A pantry is a small room in a house where people put food, plates and cutlery. Amazon will provide customers with a next-day delivery service of groceries. This will mean a lot of competition for the UK's supermarkets. Amazon Pantry customers can select from more than 4,000 goods, from food and drinks to health and beauty products. A new service called Amazon Fresh will sell fresh fruit and vegetables. It is in the planning stage and will be available later.Shoppers may not rush to use Amazon's new grocery delivery service. There is a charge of $4.50 for the first 20kg. Also, customers must already be members of Amazon's express delivery service Amazon Prime, which costs $120 a year. An Amazon Pantry spokeswoman said people would like the convenience of the service. She said it would, \"take the heavy lifting out of [refilling] the basics and store cupboard essentials that people need every day.\" She added: \"We are always looking to innovate on behalf of our customers and find ways to save them time and money.\"", "British people are working to an older age. The number of working 70-74-year-olds has doubled in the past decade. Around 10 per cent of people in their early 70s now work. This is the highest figure on record. Just over a quarter of a million 70-74-year-olds now have jobs. In 2005, it was just 100,000. The government said people are deciding to retire later. A reason for people working in their old age is because retirement pensions in Britain are becoming more difficult to live on. Many older people have to work and not retire to be able to survive.An employment spokesman said: \"The last decade has seen [big] changes in the labour market, with far more people working beyond retirement age.\" He said many people needed to earn extra money because they couldn't afford to retire. He added that older people needed good jobs and pensions so they could make a genuine choice about whether they stay in work. A spokesman for small businesses said more older people were starting their own businesses.

PCH said the number of animals is unacceptable. A PCH spokesperson said the number of pets is not allowed in the contract. The couple signed a contract to rent the house. PCH warned Mr and Mrs Restall that they must move out of the house if they do not get rid of the guinea pigs.Mr Restall, 57, said he needs his guinea pigs. They helped him fight cancer. He found out about his cancer in 2010. He bought the guinea pigs to help him forget about it. They made him happy. He told reporters that his guinea pigs are mystic. This means they have special powers to help people. He said: \"They've helped me through my cancer. They've helped me cope.\" The animals have also helped his neighbours with personal problems.

Processed meat includes bacon, hot dogs, ham, sausages, canned meat and meat-based sauces. The report was made by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. It said the world should know about the danger of processed meat because many people eat it and get cancer. The report says that eating 50g of processed meat a day can increase the chance of developing cancer by 18 per cent. Fifty grams is just two slices of bacon or one sausage. The WHO also said eating red meat also carried a risk.The WHO warned people about eating too much processed and red meat, but also said meat had health benefits. It has many important vitamins and minerals. The WHO said people should eat less processed meat and more food that contains fibre, such as fruit and vegetables. People need a balanced diet. The meat industry is not happy with the report. It does not like the fact that processed meat is in the same group as tobacco and alcohol. Processed meat is not as harmful as alcohol or tobacco. The North American Meat Institute said the report would unfairly scare people.", "The new Star Wars movie does not debut in cinemas until December, but there is already huge interest online.

It is one of Italy's big tourist destinations. Most tourists leave the 2,000-year-old city with happy memories, photos and souvenirs, but some take more. They take historic relics, like small statues, stones or mosaic tiles. Many people are now regretting this. They say the relics are cursed and have filled their lives with bad luck. A senior official at Pompeii said he has had hundreds of relics from across the world returned. Many people apologised and wrote stories about their bad luck.The senior official, Massimo Osanna, said one man from Latin America wrote about his life being full of traumas after he got home from Italy with a small tile from Pompeii. A man from Spain returned five packages, including a bronze statue he stole in 1987. He complained that the statue had put, \"a curse on his entire family\".

There are 73 million 15-24-year-olds around the world who want to work but cannot find a job. The International Labour Organization (ILO) said that although youth unemployment is coming down in rich countries, it is rising in Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and Brazil. The rate in China increased from 9.3 per cent in 2010 to 10.6 per cent last year. It could be 11.1 per cent in 2016. In Brazil, the figure was 14 per cent at the beginning of this year, but is now almost 16 per cent.The ILO said: \"It's still not easy to be young and starting out in today's labour market.\" It is worst for young women. The highest rate of youth unemployment is for women in the Middle East and North Africa. This figure is around 45 per cent. There are many reasons for the high youth unemployment. One big factor is the global financial collapse of 2008. Many countries still have problems from that. The ILO says youth unemployment is not just important for economic reasons. It also affects health, peace and levels of people's happiness.", "French radio stations are angry about a possible new government rule. DJs are already unhappy because they have to make sure that 40 per cent of the songs they play are in French. Now the government wants them to make sure the French songs are not the same popular hits or get a fine. Radio bosses say the new rule will make French people switch to music streaming services instead of listening to the radio to listen to American or British songs. Many French artists, such as Daft Punk and Phoenix, already sing in English so they can be popular around the world.France says the new law is to protect its culture from American and British influences. It wants to stop the English language from getting deeper into French culture. The French music industry said the new law is necessary for the French language and French music. He said both \"would lose out\" if radio stations were, \"allowed to do what they want when it comes to language\". French musicians say the law is important to protect French musicians.

Dementia is when the brain no longer works properly due to illness, old age or injury. People have problems remembering things. Their personality changes and they forget how to do many everyday things. A mental illness charity said dementia would affect 27 per cent of boys and 37 per cent of girls born this year. This could cause a health crisis as everyone gets older. There is no effective treatment to slow down or stop dementia. The charity said governments should do more research.An expert on dementia spoke about how serious the problem is. Dr Matthew Norton said: \"More and more people will develop dementia in the future if action is not taken now.\" He added: \"Dementia is our greatest medical challenge and if we are to beat it, we must invest in research to find new treatments.\" Globally, around 36 million people have dementia. About 10 per cent of us get it at some point in our life. This percentage will increase as people live longer. The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's. This causes the brain to lose cells so it cannot function properly.", "New research says there is a simple, easy way to help people who over-eat. It is an alternative to fancy diets. Researchers say that using smaller plates, knives, forks, glasses, etc. could reduce the amount of food we eat. Many of us use the size of the plate as a guide to how much we can eat. If we use a large plate, we fill the plate with food. This means we eat too much. Cambridge University in the U.K. says smaller plates could reduce the amount of food we eat. British people could cut their calories by up to 16 per cent, while Americans could see a reduction of up to 29 per cent.The researchers looked at data from 6,711 people. Dr Gareth Hollands said many people think it is, \"obvious that the larger the portion size, the more people eat,\" but said that there was little research on this. He added that it was wrong to think that people who ate too much had little self-control. He said: \"Helping people to avoid 'over-serving' themselves or others with larger portions of food or drink by reducing their size\u2026in shops, restaurants and in the home, is likely to be a good way of helping lots of people to reduce their risk of overeating.\"", "A best-selling video game has added to its options to attract more women players.

Dr Thomas Crowther told the BBC that this new number changes nothing. He said: \"It's not good news for the world or bad news that we've produced this new number.\"The bad news is that thousands of years ago, the earth had six trillion trees. Humans have cut the number of trees in half. An example of this is Europe. It used to be a giant forest. Now much of it is fields and cities. Dr Crowther said people are responsible for the loss of three trillion trees. Another 15 billion trees are lost each year because of deforestation and farmland. The scientists said this figure is \"considerably higher\" than a century ago. Dr Crowther warned that: \"This study highlights how much more effort is needed if we are to restore healthy forests worldwide.\"", "Over one billion people used Facebook in just one day for the very first time.

It wants forests and lost animals, birds and fish to return. The group aims to put back into the wild the wolf, which died out in Britain in 1680. Hunters killed them all. Other species that could return to mountains, rivers and seas include the lynx (a wild cat), beavers, sea eagles and grey whales. The charities want one-twentieth of the country to return to its natural state. The area it wants is the UK's cleanest region. It hopes this can happen by the year 2030.Not everyone thinks the reintroduction of the wolf and lynx is a good idea. Farmers are worried that bringing back predators would cause problems. They think the animals would start killing farm animals. They also say beaver dams would increase the risk of flooding farmland, and that sea eagles would kill lambs.

A media analyst said about Jurassic World's opening weekend record: \"No one saw this coming.\" The record for the most successful movie on an opening weekend in the US is still held by The Avengers. This took $207 million in 2012. The success of Jurassic World surprised many industry experts. They thought the film would only make $100 million in the USA. Jurassic World is the fourth part of the Jurassic Park series. The first was Jurassic Park in 1993. The latest movie was the most popular film in all 66 countries where it was released. There are many reasons for this. One reason is because many parents who watched the first Jurassic Park when they were children took their own kids to see Jurassic World. Another reason is because the movie opened in China and in the US on the same weekend. It is unusual for a movie to be released at the same time in both countries. China is the world's second biggest film market.", "There is bad news for students who use their mobile phones in class. New research shows that students do not learn very well when they text and use social media in class. The research looks at the effects of texting and social media on student learning. Researchers looked at 145 American university students in the classroom. Some of the students used their mobile phones in class, while the others had their phones switched off. The students who did not use their mobile phones during the class got higher scores on tests they took at the end of the class.One of the biggest challenges teachers have in the classroom is the battle to keep students working. Many students feel they need to be online and checking messages, even when they had work to do in class. The researchers said it is common for students to be physically present in class, but mentally absent because they are using their mobiles. Many teachers are fighting a \"losing battle\" because students are more interested in social media than classwork. Research in England found that test scores went up by six per cent after mobile phones were banned in class.", "India has banned the best selling Maggi brand of instant noodles. The noodles are made by the Swiss company Nestl\u00e9. Health authorities found the noodles contained too much lead. India's food authorities reported that the noodles had seven times more lead than is legal. They also had too much monosodium glutamate - a chemical that brings out the taste of food. News agencies say Delhi might take legal action against Nestl\u00e9 because of an unsafe product. They also say Delhi is upset that Nestl\u00e9 told people the noodles were healthy when they were not.The Indian Army has also advised its soldiers and staff not to eat Maggi noodles. It asked its canteens not to sell any more Maggi noodles. Colleges and roadside cafes will also stop selling the noodles. Millions of Indians will be without their favourite snack until Nestl\u00e9 changes its recipe. The Indian government does not like the health risk from the lead in the noodles. A health expert from the Associated Press said: \"[Too much] intake of lead can cause damage to the kidneys, bones and nervous system. It is particularly harmful to children and can cause learning disorders.\"", "Sepp Blatter is once again president of FIFA. The 79-year-old beat his only rival, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, in a vote on Friday. Mr Blatter now has another four years as FIFA's boss. In his victory speech, he said: \"I am the president now. The president of everybody.\" A big corruption scandal emerged on Wednesday. Seven top FIFA officials were arrested. Many people want Blatter to resign. There have been too many scandals at FIFA since he became president in 1998. Britain's leader David Cameron said Blatter should quit and \"the sooner the better\".Mr Blatter took responsibility for all that is wrong with FIFA. He said he would bring change and work to put FIFA in a \u201cstrong position\u201d. The boss of England's Football Association said: \"I cannot see FIFA reforming itself under Blatter. He's had 16 years to reform it and he hasn't done it.\" In those 16 years, the World Cup took place in South Africa and a lot of money went to build the game in Asia and Africa. However, FIFA's sponsors are asking big questions about the scandals. One of these is why FIFA is doing so little about the 1,200 workers who have died to make the Qatar 2022 World Cup.", "California has the worst drought in its history. Water supplies are at dangerously low levels. The state government has done many things to try to prevent water shortages. Yesterday, farmers stepped in to help to conserve water. California's farmers have agreed to cut back on water use by 25 per cent. This will be voluntary. This agreement follows action by California's governor to cut water use in cities by 25 per cent. This was started as an emergency plan but it made many city people angry. They did not want to be the only ones to have to cut back on water.California's water system serves over 30 million people and waters six million acres of farmland. It is the world's biggest and most productive water system. It also has the most problems because too many people want too little water. Farmers say it is important they get water first because they grow food. However, crops like almonds need a lot of water. People in the cities say they need water to live. There is also demand from golf courses and from rich people in the state for their swimming pools. California\u2019s population will be almost 50 million by the year 2020.", "Britain's Prince Harry wants military service to return. This is when young people spend a year or two in the army before working or going to university. In Britain, compulsory military service ended in 1960. Many countries around the world still have it. Prince Harry spent 10 years in Britain's army. He said it helped him a lot. He said the army did \"amazing things\" for him. He said it, \"does keep you out of trouble\" and that, \"different people do it for different reasons\". He added: \"I've had an epic ten years. I've had great fun. The Army keep giving me great jobs.\"Prince Harry would encourage his niece and nephew to join the army when they grow up. He said: \"I would definitely encourage George and Charlotte\u2026to have some sort of involvement in the Armed Forces.\" He said it was a great way of helping people and making them stronger for life. Harry spoke about the effect of military service on his life. He said: \"It's done no harm, just good, for me\u2026.I would say enjoy the role, because at first it's just pressure\u2026It's like any job - you've got to learn how to do it.\" Prince Harry will work in Africa from now on conservation projects.", "Research says that husbands do not do their fair share of work around the house. A study from the Ohio State University says it is rare for men to do an equal share of housework. Researchers looked at 182 working couples who became first-time parents. Both partners worked the same number of hours in full-time jobs. Men did less housework after the baby was born, even though both parents worked the same number of hours in their job. Fathers did an average of five hours a week less housework. They spent this time helping to look after the baby.Becoming a parent added about 21 hours per week to the work mothers did. Most of their extra work was spent looking after her baby. The researchers explained why new fathers did not keep up with the extra work. They said most men were unaware that the mother was doing so much more. Another reason is that after a baby is born, fathers follow what happened in their own homes when they were younger. They follow the 'traditional' roles of the mother looking after the baby and the father working, even though the mother is working the same number of hours in her job.", "Britain's Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have named their newborn baby daughter Charlotte. She was born on Saturday and since then the world has been waiting to see what she would be called. The parents Prince William and his wife Kate, waited two days to tell the world. Charlotte has two middle names, Elizabeth and Diana. Her official title is Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge. She is fourth in line to become top of Britain's royal family. If her grandfather (Prince Charles), father, and brother all die, she will be Britain's queen after Queen Elizabeth passes away.The British public is delighted with the princess' names. People like the fact that they are traditional and linked to members of the royal family. Charlotte is the female version of Charles \u2013 Prince Charles is her grandfather. A Queen Charlotte lived in the 18th century. She was married to Britain's King George III. The new princess' middle name, Elizabeth, is the same as her great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth. Finally, her second middle name, Diana, is that of her grandmother, Diana Princess of Wales. Someone tweeted: 'I love that Diana's name is in there. Such a lovely tribute to her.\"", "A new study says children who are bullied could have mental health problems when they are adults. It said bullied children are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety than children who suffered child abuse. Researchers found that the children who experienced only bullying were 1.6 times more likely to have mental health problems or to have tried to harm themselves. Researcher Dr Dieter Wolke said society thinks bullying is a normal part of childhood. He said: \"Being bullied is not a harmless\u2026or inevitable part of growing up; it has serious long-term consequences.\"Bullying is a problem around the world. In Britain, about 16,000 children stay at home because they are often bullied. Their exam results suffer and their chance of going to university or getting good jobs. Bullied children can have serious illnesses, an inability to focus on one thing for a long time, poor social skills, and have trouble keeping a job or staying in a relationship. An expert on child violence said parents and schools needed to do more about seeing and preventing bullying. She said parents needed to teach their children how to communicate well with other children.", "New Zealand Prime Minister John Key could be in trouble after he pulled a waitress' hair in a caf\u00e9. He apologised after Amanda Bailey posted online that he pulled her hair many times when he visited the caf\u00e9. Ms Bailey said the hair-pulling started last year during an election campaign. She repeatedly told him to stop and to not do it again, but he didn't listen. She could now take him to court for the crime of \"hostile touching\". A New Zealand legal expert said: \"You have to remember this is an older white male with a lot of power.\" He said Ms Bailey was in a powerless position.Mr Key apologised for his actions and said he was just joking with the waitress. People in New Zealand think the apology is not enough. A women's rights campaigner said she believed Mr Key had broken the law. She said: \"I'm getting tired of it being called anything but illegal.\" New Zealand's deputy leader Tracey Martin said it was unacceptable behaviour for a leader. She added Mr Key should understand where people's personal boundaries lie. The Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, said: \"It's never OK to touch someone without their permission.\"", "For 100 years, people said middle age was about 50 years old. This is when we grow 'old'. However, new research says this should change. A study from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIAS) in Austria says middle age now starts at 60, 65, or older. The biggest reason is that we are living longer. We are also healthier, we eat better, we exercise more and we have nicer lifestyles. The IIAS said: \"Life expectancies have increased over the past several decades.\u2026People once considered 'old' should actually be viewed as more middle aged.\"The study was not a worldwide one. The researchers looked at people in 39 European countries. Britain's National Health Service (NHS) warned against thinking this study is 100 per cent true. It said the researchers did not look at things that could reduce life expectancy and make us die younger. It said we don't know if researchers looked at the possible impact of diseases and infections. Another problem might be antibiotic resistance, or the increased number of people with diabetes because of obesity. The NHS said healthy eating and exercise was the way to live longer.", "USA-Cuban relations took a step towards becoming normal on Friday. The leaders of the two countries, Raul Castro and Barack Obama, shook hands at the Summit of the Americas in Panama. This is a meeting for North, Central and South America to discuss a better future for their continents. The historic handshake could end the bad relations between the USA and Cuba. The two countries have spoken very little for 50 years. America stopped its citizens from visiting Cuba and banned most Cuban exports to the USA. Over a decade ago, the USA said Cuba sponsored international terrorism.Castro and Obama will have a sit-down meeting to discuss a better future together. The meeting will be the highest-level talks between the USA and Cuba since 1959. A US security advisor said: \"The reason we're here is that the President strongly believes that an approach that was focused\u2026totally on seeking to cut off the Cuban people from the USA had failed.\" President Obama said he thinks the Cuban people are \"extraordinary\" and have \"huge potential\". He said the majority of Cubans \"are interested in moving forward\". The two countries are only 151 km apart.", "British people can now repair their own teeth with special dental kits. They can fix fillings (cavities in the US) and make other repairs. The kits cost as little as $7. People are buying them because they cannot afford to go to the dentist. A filling in England can cost up to $70. This is ten times higher than the price of the dental kit. One of the biggest selling products sold around 250,000 kits last year. A dental group said one in five people in the UK would do DIY dentistry on their own teeth or the teeth of their family. DIY dentistry includes pulling out a tooth.Britain is famous for its free health service, but this service does not include dental work. DIY dentistry is increasing in Britain because there is a lot of poverty and inequality.  The poorest people cannot afford a dentist. A spokeswoman for a local community said: \"DIY dentistry is fairly common here\u2026.And you've got people taking care of their whole family's teeth.\" The dental group said many people would rather spend their money on a haircut or a night out than on their teeth. It said some people think visiting the dentist is important and others don't.", "The Arab League will make a joint Arab \"army\" that could have 40,000 troops. It will be like NATO.

Then defence ministers of Arab nations will look at the ideas. The defence ministers will then choose which countries will provide the soldiers and equipment. Not all Arab League countries support the idea. Iraq said it was against it. Iraq said one Arab country should not fight in another Arab country. An Iraqi spokesperson said the best way to sort out problems was to have discussions. Lebanon said any military action should have the agreement of most countries.

Authorities want to lower the amount of pollution in the capital city. The fines could start on May 1. In April, traffic wardens in the area of Westminster will ask motorists to turn off their engines. If people do not follow their advice, the new law will start. Local people and businesses complained about the air quality. Westminster has the second highest rate of deaths from air pollution in Britain. A Westminster spokeswoman said: \"The council is committed to improving air quality in Westminster.\"The spokeswoman spoke about the importance of keeping people on the roads and reducing pollution. She said: \"Motor traffic plays an important role in keeping our city moving, which is vital for its economic prosperity. We want to raise motorist awareness of the impact engine idling can have on the environment.\" Not everyone is happy with the new fine. A motoring group said people might think the fine is a \"revenue-raising exercise\". It said traffic wardens should fine \"old buses, coaches, large trucks\u2026company vans or taxis idling for long periods\" and not energy-efficient cars.", "A researcher says having a lot of money makes you bad. Professor Paul Piff spent ten years looking at the personalities of rich people. He found their behaviour was very different to poor people's behaviour. Dr Piff said rich people break rules, do not follow the law, and do not care about others. He also said wealthy people cheat more at games and are less likely to help others. Professor Piff told the BBC that wealth makes you think more about your own interests, desires and welfare. They think their own goals and needs are the most important things in life.The professor also said poorer people are more generous than rich people. They give a higher percentage of their money to help others, usually one-and-a-half times as much as richer people. He said that the wealthier people are, the less generous they are. However, he also said rich people could change and become nicer and more generous. He said rich people can help others more if they know that giving and helping is a good thing. The professor said when rich people know the benefits of giving to others, they can be just as giving as poor people.

The Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus said it would stop by 2018. All the 43 animals it uses will be moved to an animal conservation centre. The giant creatures will retire there. The decision came after protests from the public. One hundred years ago, people thought it was OK for animals to perform for humans. However, things are different today. People are more worried about the animals. The circus will continue to use other animals, such as camels, dogs, horses, lions and tigers.Animal rights activists have criticised circuses for many years. A spokeswoman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals explained that elephants have a bad life in circuses. She said:  \"Many of the elephants are painfully arthritic, and many have tuberculosis.\" She said they should retire now. Many places in the USA have banned the use of elephants. This makes it hard for circuses to go around the country. Owners of the Ringling Brothers circus said it was not easy to stop using their elephants. They understood that there has been a \"mood shift\" among the public.", "The World Health Organisation (WHO) warns that a billion teenagers and people in their twenties and thirties are damaging their hearing with loud music. It says nearly half the young people in richer countries risk hearing loss because of listening to music at \"unsafe\" levels. Loud music in nightclubs, bars and at sporting events increases the risk. The WHO says a safe limit is to listen to music for an hour a day. The WHO director for injury prevention said: \"What we're trying to do is raise awareness of an issue that is not talked about enough.\" He said people can prevent hearing loss. Turning the volume down and listening to music for less than one hour a day could save many people's hearing. However, the WHO director also said that, \"even an hour can be too much if the volume is too loud\". A biomedical researcher explained how noise can damage ears. He said: \"Loud sounds damage your hearing by killing off thousands of little hair cells in the inner ear.

As many as 150 babies a year could be born using the new technique. The first baby to be born using the DNA from three people could be born next year. The technique will help prevent an incurable disease that affects about one in 6,500 children worldwide.The technique is simple. It combines the parents' DNA with the DNA of a female donor who does not have the disease. Doctors replace the unhealthy DNA in the mother's egg with healthy DNA from the donor. The baby receives about 0.1 per cent of its DNA from the donor. Lawmakers said this was \"light at the end of a dark tunnel\" for many families. Britain's Prime Minister said: \"We're not playing God here.
